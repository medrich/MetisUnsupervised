1,  UNFCCC COP 26 HIGH LEVEL SEGMENT Statement by the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Mr Henry Puna 10 November 2021
2," Mr President,"
3," As the Pacific Islands Forum, we are 18 countries working for a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous region."
4,We are the Blue Pacific Continent. And we are the frontlines of the climate change crisis. 
5,"Our islands, our ocean, our people already face the devastating impacts of climate change including rising seas, king tides and ravaging cyclones."
6,And so we come here to Glasgow with a critical goal in mind. 
7,To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. This is our survival roadmap. 
8,Pacific Island Forum Leaders recognise climate change as the single greatest threat to our region. 
9,That is why action at this COP 26 is so critical. 
10,"While there has been progress in the negotiations, more needs to be achieved. "
11,"COP26 must keep 1.5 degrees within reach, conclude the Paris Rulebook, and deliver scaled up climate finance."
12,COP26 must also accelerate work on Loss and Damage and on oceans. 
13,"Mr President, Pacific Leaders are leading on climate action despite contributing negligibly to the crisis. "
14,
15,"Pacific Leaders have endorsed a Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate Change-related Sea-level Rise and a Pacific Resilience Facility, to build resilient communities. "
16," Mr President, our future  as oceanic peoples living on a sea of islands - is in the hands of this multilateral process. "
17,Let me implore all countries - especially the big emitters - to act with ambition.  To act now. 
18,We cannot delay. 
19,Thank you.

Fulfilling this pledge will reduce the impacts of climate change and help developing nations adapt to it. In addition, there is a strong need to create an investment ecosystem to support sustainable growth. The UAE has been a pioneer in supporting developing countries to adopt renewable energy  We have, for example, committed more than one billion dollars in development aid for clean energy projects in more than 70 countries. Alongside IRENA, headquartered in UAE, we have announced 400 million dollars in new funding for the Energy  to boost investment and solutions in renewables. Further  alongside the United States and over 30 other countries, we have launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate to accelerate innovation for agri-tech. "

33,"Speech by the President of the Republic of Finland, Mr. Sauli Niinistö, at the World  Summit in Glasgow on Tuesday, 2 November 2021"
34,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
35,"more than 40 years ago, in 1979, experts from around the world met in Geneva at the first World Climate Conference. In that conference, climate change was recognized as a serious threat. In 1990, the IPCC published its first assessment report that highlighted the global consequences of climate change. For decades, science has been sounding the alarm bell. During these decades, we have gained more knowledge. We know the risks."
36," A lot has been done. The Paris Agreement was a historic milestone, and after that, many countries have set new climate goals.Finland belongs to the most ambitious: we aim to be carbon neutral by 2035."
37,But we have reached a point where we need to move beyond goals and pledges. Change may seem inconceivable but only until we act. Combatting climate change is one of our weightiest human responsibilities.
38,"*** Ensuring adequate climate finance is crucial. Finland is doing its part by almost doubling its climate finance to developing countries. By co-chairing the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, "
39,we also encourage the integration of climate action into national budgeting. Many truly impactful measures lie in this domain.
40," As an arctic country, Finland is particularly concerned about the fast-warming Arctic region. Everyone else should be concerned too: if we lose the arctic, we lose the globe. In the Arctic, reducing black carbon and methane emissions is essential. "
41," take care of our carbon sinks. As the most forested country in Europe, Finland places great importance to sustainable use of forests. Every year, 150 million trees are planted in Finland. Globally, we need to strengthen efforts to halt forest loss. *** Ladies and Gentlemen,"
42," Conference of EAlready more than 40 years ago we knew that climate change is the result of the actions of mankind, and that it can determine the future of mankind. Now it is time to deliver on our pledges and shoulder our human responsibilities. "

52,"8. Regionally, we are playing our part to catalyse green finance to support ."
53,"a. We have introduced initiatives to enhance financial sector resilience to environmental risks, develop green finance solutions and capabilities, and leverage technology to mobilise sustainable capital. We are collaborating with other central banks, regulators, and international platforms such as the G20, Financial Stability Board and the Network for Greening the Financial System, to mainstream green finance, and enhance comparability and reliability of sustainability-related disclosures."
54,"b. We are growing our ecosystem of services in carbon markets and carbon management, and partnering stakeholders, including those in the region, in the development of a high-quality carbon market. Climate Impact X1, a global carbon exchange and marketplace for high-quality and risk-rated carbon credits, will be launched in Singapore. The exchange will leverage technology such as satellite monitoring to ensure the transparency and integrity of carbon credits."
55,"9. Singapore is supporting efforts to build and enhance climate resilience, particularly in our region.  a. Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and our Climate Action Package, we have shared our experiences with more than 132,000 government officials from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations in areas such as the green economy, sustainable development, urban planning, flood and water management, disaster risk reduction. , b. We have committed S$5 million over five years, from 2018 to 2022, through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) to help build capabilities in weather forecasting and haze monitoring. "
56,"c. Together with Japan and the World Bank, we jointly established the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF) in  1 Climate Impact X (CIX) was established by DBS Bank , Singapore Exchange , Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek."
57,
58,"  5. How fast we can move also depends on the development and maturity of emerging low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen. As and when international collaborations and new enabling technologies materialise, we will review and enhance our climate goals.  Importance of International Partnerships and Regional Cooperation"
59,6. nternational partnerships can strengthen our collective global climate action. We have joined several coalitions over the past week in Glasgow.
60,"a. -26 to be one that we are pleased to be among the first countries in Asia to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, led by the UK and Canada. We have supported the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement. Having pivoted from fuel oil to natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for electricity generation 2 decades ago, we will phase out unabated coal power generation completely by 2050. We already do not finance unabated coal power projects overseas."
61,"b. We are pleased to have joined the Global Methane Pledge, led by the US and the EU, in support of its collective goal to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030."
62," c. We have also joined the Greening Government Initiative (GGI), led by the US and Canada, to facilitate cooperation and innovation in greening government operations. Joining the GGI complements our domestic efforts under GreenGov.SG, an initiative under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, to deliver on ambitious sustainability goals by the public sector."
63,"d. In line with our 30-by-30 goal to produce 30% of nutritional needs by 2030, we have joined the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C), led by the US and the United Arab Emirates, aimed at accelerating investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation."
64," 7. Apart from these initiatives, we are working closely with partners such as Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and the US to collaborate on emerging low-carbon technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen and CCUS. We have commenced negotiations on a bilateral Green Economy Agreement (GEA) with Australia, which will be a world-first agreement that combines trade, economic "
65,"  July, we which will offset 33,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. "
66,"ii. Besides pushing the bounds on domestic sources of renewable energy, we also plan to further reduce the carbon footprint of our power sector by importing up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will constitute around 30% of ."
67,"iii. We are aggressively pushing for a cleaner and more efficient transport system. Since 2018, vehicle growth has been capped at zero for private cars and motorcycles. We aim to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040."
68," iv. Under the OneMillionTrees movement, we aim to restore nature back into our city through the planting of more than one million trees across Singapore by 2030. This forms part of our greening efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature as one of the five pillars of our Singapore Green Plan 2030."
69,"v. W80-80- to (1) greening 80% of our buildings by 2030, (2) 80% of new developments from 2030 onwards to be Super Low Energy buildings, and (3) 80% improvement in energy efficiency for green buildings by 2030. "
70,"vi. We have implemented a carbon tax, the first in Southeast Asia, since 2019. And we are reviewing the level and trajectory of our carbon tax to reflect the cost of carbon in investment decisions effectively. We will announce the outcomes of our review early next year. "
71,"4. International collaboration, in areas such as carbon markets and regional power grids, is crucial for Singapore to achieve our decarbonisation goals.  We are working actively to tap low-carbon energy beyond our shores. Regional power grids can help to accelerate the investments and development of low-carbon energy in the region and enhance electricity security and resilience for connected parties. We hope our trials and pilots to import electricity from Malaysia and Indonesia, and through regional arrangements such as the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, will serve as a pathfinder towards a broader ASEAN Power Grid vision, where low-carbon electricity is traded freely between ASEAN countries.   "
72,"  d. Fourth, we must strengthen partnerships. Nations cannot do this alone. To achieve an effective transition to a net zero future, we need  i. We welcome the progress at the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action in galvanising partnerships between governments, businesses, cities and civil society."
73," ii. We must continue to build on these and other initiatives launched by the UK and other coalition partners at this conference. We hope to see these multi-stakeholder alliances spur a global clean energy transition, as we collectively develop and deploy cutting-edge technologies such as low carbon hydrogen and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)."
74, Singapore committed to playing our part
75,"3. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore is committed to playing our part in the global fight against climate change."
76,a. We take our Paris commitments seriously and are taking bold climate actions. 
77,i. Singapore was one of the first 20 Parties to submit our enhanced NDC and LEDS in March last year.
78,"ii. In February this year, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which complements our NDC and LEDS and sets out concrete near-term plans to achieve our net zero aspiration."
79,"b. As a small city-state with limited land and limited access to renewable energy, we face stark trade-offs. With a population density of more than twice that of Glasgow and no hinterland for green power, we do not have ready options to mitigate our emissions. But we do not shy away from taking bold actions where we can."
80,"  i. We are continually pushing the bounds of solar energy, which is our only viable source of renewable energy currently.  We aim to quadruple our solar deployment by 2025 from 2020 levels. In "
81,"  needs of all Parties, while safeguarding environmental integrity."
82,ii. We shall also finalise the outstanding technical work under the Enhanced Transparency Framework and come to a decision on common reporting timeframes for NDCs.
83,The completion of the Paris Rulebook will see us shifting from negotiations to concrete implementation and collaboration. It is time for us to put an end to this chapter that has gone on for 6 years.
84,"c. Third, COP-26 must deliver a strong support package for developing countries. This will enable developing countries to implement effective adaptation strategies and achieve their climate pledges, so that we can "
85,i. Developed countries should fulfil their commitment to mobilise US$100 billion per year in climate finance to support the climate actions of developing countries.
86,ii. Climate finance would need to take into account the needs of developing countries. We encourage developed countries to consider the recommendations of the Standing Committee on first report on the needs of developing countries when delivering on climate finance for developing countries.
87,"iii. Looking ahead, we must address the long-standing imbalance between mitigation and adaptation financing. This is particularly important for many vulnerable low-lying Small Island Developing States (SIDS) for which rising sea levels already threaten lives and livelihoods."
88,iv. We also look forward to constructive deliberations over the new collective quantified goal (NCG) on climate finance. We hope that the lessons gained from the US$100 billion goal can be applied to the NCG to achieve a post-2025 climate finance goal that is mutually agreed and in line with the Paris Agreement.

90,"  NATIONAL STATEMENT OF SINGAPORE DELIVERED BY GRACE FU, MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, AT THE UNFCCC COP-26 HIGH LEVEL SEGMENT, 9 NOVEMBER 2021, GLASGOW, THE UNITED KINGDOM"
91,"Mr President, "
92,"1. Congratulations on your election as President of this Conference. I thank the UK Government, the City of Glasgow, and the UNFCCC Secretariat, for their efforts in organising COP-26 in a safe and efficient manner. I also thank the Chilean and UK COP Presidencies for their able leadership in the lead-up to this conference, in guiding Parties to advance discussions in a transparent and facilitative manner. COP-26: A Push for Global Climate Action "
93,"2. Even as we grapple with COVID-19, we need to take urgent collective action to address the global climate crisis. COP-26 must make up for lost time. It has been almost six years since the Paris Agreement was adopted. This conference needs to demonstrate that the multilateral framework of cooperation delivers on climate action. a. First, COP-26 must work collectively towards the long-term temperature goal under the Paris Agreement. "
94,"i. All Parties must come forward with ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), and deliver concrete implementation plans to achieve them."
95,"ii. While it is clear from the NDC synthesis report that we are not there yet, COP-26 must provide a clear roadmap on how we will close this gap post-Glasgow, to keep 1.5 degrees within reach."
96,"b. Second, we must complete outstanding negotiations under the Paris Agreement Work Programme, or the ."
97,"i. As co-facilitator for ministerial consultations on Article 6, alongside Norway, Singapore will work with all Parties in this final stretch to identify pragmatic solutions to achieve a credible and balanced package under this track that meets the "
98,  Singapore to enable ASEAN countries to access disaster risk financing solutions and increase financial resilience to climate and disaster risks. The first financial solution developed by SEADRIF is a regional flood risk insurance pool to provide post-disaster rapid response financing.
99,"Closing remarks 10. Mr President, the climate crisis is a wicked problem too big for any country to solve alone. Each country must pursue clear and effective climate actions that represent its highest possible ambition, in the light of its size, resource endowment, capabilities and constraints. Our national circumstances may be different, but the problem is a shared one.  11. Beyond individual actions, we need strong and effective international cooperation. Global solidarity will help us overcome our respective challenges and achieve an outcome that is far greater than the sum of our parts.   12. Singapore is committed to doing our part and will work with the UK and all Parties to secure strong outcomes for COP-26. Thank you."

102,"Those of us in the developed world  those who have, frankly, contributed most to the problems that confront us all  have an obligation to support those who are most acutely challenged by their consequences. Ireland accepts that obligation.  In support of achieving the $100bn target, I am therefore pleased to announce today that Ireland will more than double its contribution to developing countries, so that we are delivering year by 2025.  As leaders, if we are to bring people with us on this journey of a lifetime we must also recognise and respect the real anxiety that many people feel when confronted by such an enormous challenge.  Our young people worry that there will be no worthwhile future for them to inherit.  Workers worry that their jobs will disappear, leaving them without a livelihood. "
103,Page | 3
104,"We are working at the UN Security Council to put the destabilising impacts of climate change firmly on the agenda. We do not believe or accept, as some would have it, that it is too late; that the transition will be too costly; that it is inevitable that we will leave people behind; that someone else should shoulder the load. We believe in the immense capacity of humans to work together and to achieve great things. If we act decisively now, we will offer humanity the most valuable prize of all  a liveable planet.  We can achieve a cooler world. A biodiverse world. A world with healthier air for us to breathe, healthier soil for things to grow in. A world in which people can live more sustainable lives, handing a healing and enriched planet to future generations.  We can create a world in which human impact on all parts of our ecosphere  the land, the sea, the air - is brought back into balance.  "
105,Page | 2
106,"The scientists are playing their part, in helping us to understand the dynamics of climate change and in developing the technologies and responses we need to limit its effect.  As political leaders, it is our responsibility to put the necessary policies in place.  Ireland is ready to play its part.  We have enacted legislation to put a legally binding target of reducing our emissions by 2030 to 51% below 2018 levels.  We will reach climate neutrality by 2050. We are working closely with our EU partners in the green transition that will make Europe the first climate-neutral continent. We are implementing a statutory system of carbon budgeting and emissions ceilings for each sector of the economy. "
107,"National Statement by the Taoiseach, COP 26, Glasgow, 2 November 2021 Excellencies, people.  We come here as leaders, and it is vital that we offer the leadership the world now urgently needs. Climate change is real  we are seeing its serious impacts already. The IPCC Report in August confirmed to us that it is widespread, it is rapid, and it is intensifying.  The scale of this change is unprecedented. But, as the Report made clear, it is not too late.  Human actions still have the potential to determine the future course of climate, the very future of our planet. To achieve our Paris goals, immediate, large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are essential. Unless we act now, we will not keep the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees alive. "
108,Page | 5
109,"Consumers, already feeling the impact of energy price rises, feel that the transition will be too costly for them to bear. In response, I say I will do everything in my power, working with all of the leaders here today, to make sure that it is not so.  To ensure that we will succeed in limiting emissions; to ensure that the transition we deliver is jobs-rich and economically sustainable; to ensure that there is real climate justice and nobody, in any part of the world, is left behind. The IPCC report made it clear that every tonne of carbon warms the world.  Every second of delay makes our task that bit bigger.  Let us leave Glasgow with a renewed commitment to doing what we know needs to be done. Let us move forward together now. "
110,3
111,"Mr. President The science clearly indicates that now is the time for all leaders to walk the talk and immediately start implementing the Paris Agreement roadmap. The 2030 climate and energy package  NDC is, for an example, an opportunity for us to show leadership in adopting more ambitious targets for renewables and energy efficiency in coherence with the Paris Agreement. It is an opportunity to prove that SIDS are prepared to lead by example by scaling up their ambition at home. Seychelles will protect at least 50% of our seagrass and mangrove ecosystems by 2025 and 100% by 2030 as nature-based blue carbon ocean climate action. We also intend to regulate coastal planning and infrastructure at the national and local level to prioritize nature-based solutions."
112," As you can see, Mr President, ambitious ocean action is a key priority for my government as a SIDS and a big ocean state as we look to address the climate and biodiversity crises together wherever we can while enhancing our Blue Economy. Mr. President We once again urge all governments - with the major emitters taking the lead in cutting emissions and the industrialised countries in providing the promised support to developing countries - to continue to step up to meet the ever-growing challenge of tackling climate change to the scale that the worsening crisis demands. Allow me to say in closing, that the international community has shown in the way it tackled COVID-19 that it can act swiftly and decisively when it wants to. Climate change will be with us long after we have brought the pandemic under control and with far greater consequences. So I challenge the world, Mr President, to respond as we did to COVID-19 and take climate action as if the futures of our countries and economies, and indeed our lives, depend on it, because they do."
113,I thank you for your attention
114,
115,2
116,"Mr. President The world must build a vision for a climate resilient future that puts adaptation and loss and damage at the centre of decision-making, and take immediate action now to protect people, the economy, and the environment. Seychelles acknowledges that adaptation challenges require inclusive and sensitive global action, and we share a collective ambition, in line with the SDGs, to achieve a global society in which no person, no country is left behind. It is imperative that we step up our efforts to meet these urgent challenges.  Mr. President Seychelles, therefore, calls on industrialized countries to take the lead in stepping up and displaying the leadership they claim to stake to the level that the science tells us is required to keep 1.5 alive! Clinging to coal and failing to help us all accelerate the clean energy transition while parading as climate champions is nothing but bad faith. We have in this COP the daunting task of concluding the Paris rulebook before we leave Glasgow. Countries need to rediscover the political courage they had in Paris in 2015 to complete the rulebook on time. We must build the vessels we need to carry us towards a low carbon and clean energy future. It is now up to us leaders to fill these vessels with increased ambition on climate action to close the substantial gap between the commitments countries have put forward to reduce their emissions and the much higher level of ambition needed to meet the temperature limitation goals established in the Paris Agreement."
117," We must pick up the pace of the negotiations significantly if the Paris Agreement implementation rules are to be finalised at this COP. Mr. President Substantial progress also has to be made on the critical issue of ramping up financial and capacity-building support to SIDS like Seychelles and other developing countries to accelerate the deployment of clean energy, nature-based and other climate solutions, and to better meet the worsening impacts of climate change; this must be a much higher priority going forward because the USD 100 billion per year in climate financing by 2020 as pledged is long overdue.

120,Mr President
121,We are honoured to be here today and join those who have already spoken before in thanking The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the city of Glasgow and its people for their warm hospitality and for the opportunity to address our crisis.
122," Our presence here today, despite the on-going COVID 19 pandemic, demonstrates how crucial climate change is on our Agenda. The lives that will be lost due to the adverse effects of climate change if we do not act now, will be much worse than the pandemic. Needless to say, our issues have been further compounded with the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic."
123,"Like other Small Island Developing States, the Republic of Seychelles recognises that building resilience to climate change and committing to a low-emission development pathway provide a firm basis for continued growth and sustainable development. We view climate change as an increasingly dire emergency that challenges all aspects of our chances for future survival and o fully achieve the sustainable development goals."
124,"Nonetheless, Seychelles stands steadfast alongside our fellow SIDS in remaining politically, morally, and socially committed. Meaningful progress on climate action is urgently required, as highlighted by the IPCC and WMO recently to put us on a path to a 1.5°C future."
125,"As small as our contributions are to the degradation of the planet, we are committed to further reducing them through our updated Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC because we feel it and we know it. Our issues have been further compounded by the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic.  "

165,"STATEMENT BY H.E. MR. KHURELSUKH UKHNAA,"
166,PRESIDENT OF MONGOLIA AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF  THE COP26 WORLD LEADERS SUMMIT
167,"(Glasgow, 1 November 2021)"
168," Mr. President,  Mr. Secretary-General,  Distinguished delegates,  Ladies and gentlemen, "
169,I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of the United Kingdom for hosting the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and wish every success to the work of the session. 
170,"It is universally acknowledged that in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement by 2050, every country needs to reconsider its efforts and strive together through a bold and comprehensive policy."
171,This challenging time when the humanity is facing the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we need to change our attitude towards nature and take bold and decisive measures to accelerate green growth. 
172," Mr. President, "
173,"Mongolia, as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, fully supports efforts of the international community to reach net-zero emissions and reaffirms its commitments to the Paris Agreement and to mobilize every possible resource to fulfill them. "
174,"Mongolia raised its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a main cause of climate change, to 22.7 per cent by 2030, through updating its Nationally Determined Contributions. "
175,I am pleased to announce from this podium that there is an opportunity to increase our commitment to 27.2 per cent through introduction of advanced technology and innovation and increase of necessary funding. 
176, 
177, 
178,2
179,"Mr. President, "
180,It is crucial to develop a cross border energy network in the Northeast Asian region in order to meet its growing energy consumption and enhance production of renewable energy. 
181,"Mongolia supports the Asian Super Grid Initiative for increasing renewable energy sources and improving energy supply in Northeast Asia. Within this framework, we are actively collaborating with the countries in the region to build a large energy complex based on the vast solar and wind resources of the Gobi region. "
182,"Taking this opportunity, I would like to underscore that Mongolia has successfully organized an International Dialogue o-two weeks ago in Ulaanbaatar ahead of the COP26 Summit. "
183,"As a national contribution to combating climate change, Mongolia has launched a national campaign to plant billions of trees by 2030 in order to reach net-zero emission targets, reduce poverty or combat desertification through economic means, protect the health of children and women who are the most vulnerable to climate change, and improve overall quality of life. "
184,"Thus, Mongolia has decided to spend at least 1 per cent of its GDP annually to mitigate adverse effects of climate change and desertification."
185," Mongolians say ""the source of life is water and the source of water is tree."" We believe that the implementation of planting billions of trees initiative, which is the manifestation of our traditional culture to care for nature, will make a significant contribution to reducing dust storms that affect the ecology, health and economy of not only Asia, but also the Americas.   "
186," Mr. President, "
187,"Last but not least, I would like to emphasize the important role of a close regional and international cooperation in increasing capital inflows for low and middle-income countries to combat climate change. "
188,"Only our common understanding, collaboration, resolve and perseverance are utmost important to achieve our mission to fight climate change, the world's greatest challenge of all time, and have a responsible approach to nature and leave a greener world for our descendants."
189, It is time for the nations of the world to combine their efforts for this deed. 
190,I thank you for your attention. 
191,
192,"Mr. President, , Ladies and Gentlemen,"
193,On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan it is a great honor for me to address this gathering.
194,"Tajikistan, as a mountainous landlocked country, forms about sixty percent of the water resources of Central Asia, and is the main location of regions glaciers, where the bulk of the region's water resources are formed, thus playing an important role in ensuring sustainable development in the entire Central Asian region."
195,"We over the recent years observe rapid melting of glaciers, dramatic reduction of water resources, increase of mudflows and floods, droughts and other natural disasters induced by climate change. This situation has been causing a significant damage to our national economy and severely undermines our efforts towards achieving sustainable development."
196, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the proposal of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan to proclaim 2025 as the International Year for Glaciers Preservation.
197,"Tajikistan repeatedly appeals international community to create an International Fund for Glaciers Preservation, through which we could mobilize efforts and resources for practical steps to preserve glaciers - the most important source of fresh water in Central Asia."
198, 
199, 
200, 
201, 
202,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
203,"The contribution of our country in terms of GHG emissions is minimal. Nevertheless, Tajikistan in its updated version of the Nationally Determined Contribution undertook enhanced commitment to reduce GHG emissions within 60-70%, and within 50-60% with significant attraction of international assistance."
204,"This will mainly be achieved through the development of hydropower resources, the potential of which is enormous in the country. With the global community's new aspirations to achieve net zero ambition, we commit to doubling our hydroelectric capacity by 2050."
205," Additionally, to reduce emissions from the transport sector, we intend to accelerate the transformation of , implement afforestation programs to increasing the carbon-capturing capacity of Tajikistan."
206,"Of course, without the necessary resources, i.e. finance, capacity building and technology transfer, the achievement of the assigned tasks can take many years. Therefore, for many developing countries, the proactive assistance of the international community is in great demand."
207,"Given the national circumstances, Tajikistan would like to urge for more focus on adaptation measures, enhanced accessibility and clear delivery plan for climate finance for developing countries."
208,"Distinguished delegates,"
209,Tajikistan looks forward to working with the Presidency and our development partners to address urgent and long-term issues in a collaborative manner to achieve concrete and tangible results.
210,Thank you very much! 
211," 2 Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
212,COP has met several times since we agreed in Paris to reach net zero by mid-century. Yet the science is very clear: we are nowhere near this goal.
213,"Glasgow is make-or-break for the planet. We must double down on our efforts to cut emissions and mitigate the impact of the climate crisis. If we fail, the only thing to discuss at future COPs will be the irreversible devastation of our planet and its habitats. This scenario is just about avoidable  but so far, we seem to be failing to prevent it."
214,"The young generation understands this. In my own country, Slovakia, 42% of young people are very worried about the climate crisis. 73% think humanity has failed to look after our planet. Two thirds find  actions to address the climate crisis disappointing. A recent study carried out in a number of other countries has shown that 40% of young people consider not having children because of the climate crisis."
215,"It is clear: the next generation knows we are running out of time. And we as political leaders have run out of excuses. I am glad that as the European Union, we are doing what is needed: reducing our emissions by at least 55% by 2030, becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and helping developing countries do the same."
216," own emissions are down by 46% compared to 1990 levels, with methane reduced by more than half. Our electricity mix is already 80% low on carbon, and, from 2023, we will not use coal to produce electricity. 43% of our post-pandemic recovery funds will support sustainable green transition in transport, industry or buildings, while not leaving the most vulnerable behind."
217,"We know that this alone will not prevent the worst-case scenarios. It takes truly global action: not just by the EU and the rest of the developed world, although we do shoulder a special responsibility. We must all do our fair share  including those states whose top "

227,"Excellencies,"
228,The carbon footprint of the planes we arrived on cannot be the only output from this  COP. We must turn the Paris commitments into credible delivery and real CO2 reductions. We have different starting points and paths for development  but we do have one shared goal: preserving our planet.  act accordingly. Thank you.

It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece having to move in unison. The science tells us that tackling emissions has many paths. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, for countries or industries. The narrative that the energy transition is from oil and other fossil fuels to renewables is misleading and potentially dangerous to a world that will continue to be thirsty for all energy sources.  The capacities, national circumstances, and development priorities of developing countries must be taken into account. The adverse socio-economic impacts on developing countries due to mitigation activities should be considered, to identify remediation measures and share best practices. Financing is critical to reach climate targets set in developing countries™ NDCs. Developing countries have underscored the need for enhanced support, including financial resources, technological development and transfer, and capacity building, as well as a new collective goal for climate finance, to aid "

It is a landmark COP, where the future of humanity is at stake.  With negotiations of such magnitude and consequence, we must remember the often ignored scientific fact: climate change and energy poverty are two sides of the same coin.  The delicate balance between reducing emissions, energy affordability and security requires comprehensive and sustainable policies, with all voices being heard, and listened to. Focusing on only one of these over the others can lead to unintended consequences; market distortions, heightened volatility and energy shortfalls.  We need to ensure energy is available and affordable for all; we need to move towards a more inclusive, fair "

OPEC advocates putting multilateralism at the centre of energy, climate and sustainable development. We remain committed to the UNFCCC process, particularly the core elements of equity, common-but-differentiated responsibilities and national circumstances. The oil and gas industry can foster its resources and expertise to help unlock a low-emissions future, through its role as a powerful innovator in developing more efficient technological solutions. OPEC subscribes to a sustainable path forward; one that works for us all. *******   "

233,5. St. Vincent and the Grenadines therefore calls for URGENT action to avert this climate crisis.
234,6. The UNFCCC Synthesis Report clearly indicates that current NDCs are woefully inadequate.
235,7. They will NOT bridge the gap between existing commitments and the 1.5  pathway.
236,"8. We MUST accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in this DECISIVE DECADE, to achieve net zero by 2050."
237,9. Failure to take the necessary steps to address this climate crisis is reckless and endangers the 72 million people living in Small Island Developing States.
238,10. To compromise on the required targets and measures is a death sentence for our people!
239,11. Negotiating your way out of this responsibility is not an option!
240,"12. Mr. President, my country continues to do its part both nationally, and internationally as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, in the global fight against climate change."

244,1. Mr. President.
245,2. Excellencies and distinguished colleagues.
246,"3. This past year has been the most challenging period in St. Vincent and post-colonial history. We continue to grapple with the challenges precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic,  the devastation caused by the explosive eruption of the La Soufriere Volcano, and severe floods and landslides due to more extreme weather phenomena. These challenges underscore our intrinsic vulnerabilities and threaten our very existence."
247,"4. Mr. President, the most pertinent questions for our people are the following: "
248,- How long will aspirational declarations and diplomatic maneuvering delay the concrete actions required to ensure our planet remains below the 1.5 degree target?
249,- Will  developed countries acknowledge that insufficient funding for adaptation measures results in catastrophic loss and damage to  SIDS?
250,"- Will G20 countries, responsible for nearly 80% of carbon emissions, honour their commitment to develop and implement ambitious NDCs to reduce global emissions?"

276,"  at the UN Climate Change Conference Mister President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Lithuania is committed to be a part of the global solution.  As nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, it is time for us to come together as humankind. Big and small, North and South, rich and poor  we must all change our ways and stop the climate crisis that leads to biodiversity loss and threats to public health. Lithuania knows that crises come with opportunities. We know the power of change. Ten years ago, we transformed our heating sector by switching from natural gas to sustainable indigenous biomass. We kept more money in and we also reduced pollution emissions, while staying competitive.  Today Lithuania strongly supports international and EU climate change goals. We have already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 58 percent. Our plan, endorsed by the parliament, is to go further: to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to cover at least 50 percent of our electricity needs from renewables. The whole Lithuanian economy will be climate neutral by 2050. As fossil fuel prices are reaching new highs, I see new opportunities. The Paris Agreement together with the digitization drive form a clear roadmap. To achieve ambitious goals, new partnerships must be forged both locally and internationally."
277,"That is why I called on Lithuanian municipalities, businesses, industries, , and every Lithuanian to join the Green Lithuania Declaration. My country also encourages closer regional cooperation and actions to tackle climate change and the deterioration of the Baltic Sea, and to better preserve our nature. "
278, 
279, 
280,"  As a global community, we should rethink the ways we produce and consume. For the industry production to leave no CO2 footprint, it needs to move closer to consumer markets. We should also pay more attention to compliance with the highest environmental and nuclear standards. Our technological shift should be sustainable and environmentally friendly. Fellow Leaders, we all hold keys to a better future. Let us use them for global welfare! "
281,"In the name of God Mr. President, Executive secretary of UNFCCC, Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen"
282,"It is indeed a pleasure to be present in this august meeting, First of all, I would like to inform that my president his excellency Dr Mahammad Ebrahim Raisi was very much willing to attend this summit for not only his personal attachment to climate change and environmental issues, but also for the legal obligations according on domestic laws and regulation of my government to protect the collective right to clean and protect environment of Iranian nation. however, on his behalf I would like to extend his best wishes for the success of this conference. Mr. president The government of Islamic republic of Iran is committed alongside with other nations to combat climate change and global warming with the full support of the Supreme Leader. The government and Iranian environment department whose head is of the rank of vice president, devise a very ambitious national plan to cope with the consequences of climate change. However, Mr. President, when it comes the international cooperation and all stakeholders globally unfortunately my country faces an obstacle which is economic terrorism.  Mr. president  We are facing a relevant questions raised by members of parliament when they are in the legal process of ratification of Paris Agreement, that question is: if the Islamic republic of Iran becomes the full member of Paris agreement while unilateral coercive sanction or measures are imposed on the whole country of Iran, how the government would be able to implement its commitments if it is unable to receive any international assistance being financial or technical assistance from international community. That question still remains unanswered. And I put the same question before you Mr. president and all member state around this table why blind coercive measures are imposed on my country and few others which not only are inflicting sufferings on a nation but also is undermining the global efforts to combat climate change to the benefit of the humanity. This is the sad long story of taking human issues as a hostage for political objective of a few if not one. "

285," Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Guests,"
286,"As a small country, we do acknowledge that our national contribution towards tackling the impacts of climate change is indeed limited. "
287,"We, therefore, seek to enhance regional cooperation through coordinated synergies and sharing best practices, taking into account that the Mediterranean and Middle East is classified as a ange hot-"
288,"Within this framework, we have undertaken the initiative of developing a Regional Action Plan, with the involvement of more than 240 scientists from our wider region, as well as various international organisations, who are already preparing policy recommendations, measures and specific solutions."
289," With the finalisation of the scientific part of the Action Plan which will establish the foundations of our future steps, within the coming months we will hold a Ministerial Meeting and a Leaderthat will initiate appropriate coordination and monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of our commitments.

292,4.    As well as the US initiative: The Global Methane Pledge Initiative and the Greening Government Initiative. 
293,"Further, in addition to our commitment to adhering to the targets of the said Declarations and Initiatives, Cyprus also remains fully committed to take all necessary measures so as to achieve the Paris Agreement and the EU targets, with the aim of achieving a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. "
294,"To this end, and as a first step in accomplishing these ambitious but highly-needed goals, my country will allocate more than 500 million euro up until 2026, adopting new policies and measures as regards using cleaner fuels - such as natural gas and renewable energy sources - and promoting necessary investments in the relevant areas of Transport, Agriculture, Industry, Land Use and Forestry and Waste Management."
295, 
296,2
297," However, currently, and we have to be honest so as to strengthen our efforts in fulfilling our promises, there is no sign that we are growing back greener, since not only planetary warming is accelerating, but we are witnessing around the globe protracted heat waves, devastating fires and deforestation, increased water scarcity, droughts, floods and extreme weather patterns. "
298,"That is why I have no doubt that COP26 can and should prove to be the historic milestone in the efforts to address the said devastating impacts, by ensuring the highest possible commitment from all participating countries, in a way that is fair, efficient and transparent, whilst maintaining solidarity towards vulnerable countries that will be severely affected."

306,"Allow me at the outset to convey my deep appreciation and sincere congratulations to the Government of the United Kingdom for hosting COP26, as well as the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change for organising this extremely important and timely Conference for averting the challenges associated with climate change. "
307,"Challenges that are global and can only be mitigated if we all act together, with a sense of utmost urgency and joint commitment towards enhancing joint action and accelerating global transformation to a low carbon and climate resilient society."
308," Our target towards this goal was clearly identified six years ago at COP21 in Paris, when we collectively pledged to cut greenhouse emissions so as to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with pre-industrial times.  "

310," Dear Friends,"
311,"We are compelled, and people expect from us, to take on urgent action to address climate change and I am certain that you will agree with me that the time to act is upon us. "
312," Our vision should be none other than to look to the future with optimism and to use the climate challenge as an opportunity to proudly demonstrate what all countries, what humanity can achieve when we join forces. "
313,"I have no doubt that by decisively cooperating and acting together, with unity and greater urgency, we will be able to overcome the dire consequences of a warming planet and bring forward the necessary changes for a sustainable future, so as for our generation and the coming ones to enjoy better health and living conditions, improved air quality and a green environment."

318,"Too often, medium and long-term adaptation finance and implementation have been left to the private sector to handle. Private sector support is critical and should be enhanced, but it should not overshadow the important resources that can be offered through international public finance. We must mobilize large-scale adaptation financing nowfinancing that is not delayed by COVID-19; that prioritizes the most vulnerable; and that is sourced through the Markets Mechanism and delivered through public and grant-based financing, rather than loans. Our success as Pacific SIDS depends on this. We must cooperate to conclude Article 6 negotiations and finalize an Article 6 that delivers substantial overall mitigation in global emissions, as well as substantial financial resources to assist vulnerable developing countries in meeting the costs of adaptation.   Mr. President, However we adapt to cope with the increasing devastation of climate change and sea level rise, for some of us, the capacity to adapt is waning, for technical and financial reasons. Consequently, we will bear the burden of significant costs due to loss and damage even at safer temperature levels. Therefore, we call on all parties to cooperate and conclude the Warsaw International Mechanism and the work of the Santiago Network. We cannot allow the reallocation of adaptation funding to address loss and damage. We require stronger guidance on loss and damage financing, and we must develop new financing mechanisms or funding windows for loss and damage. This would include consideration of the impacts of climate change on fisheries as part of loss and damage under slow onset events. Mr. President, The existential threat of climate change and sea level rise has strengthened our resolve to preserve our statehood and sovereignty. In this respect, we have embarked on international discussion on legal mechanisms that can recognize our maritime boundaries and assets as permanent despite the impacts of sea level rise. We must also ensure that legal mechanisms are in place to protect the cultures, languages, and heritages of nations like Tuvalu, including through digitization and building mobile digital nations.  We must uphold domestic, regional, and international endeavors to this effect, such as the Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise. This regional declaration was endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders this year and seeks to ced as a result of climate change-related sea-level rise.  In the midst of COP26, we signed an agreement with the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda to establish a Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law. The Commission is authorized to request advisory opinions from the International Tribunal for the Law "
319,"and uncertainty? A future replete with conflict as climate impacts exacerbate social tensions? None of us, as responsible leaders, would want that for our youth and our future generations.  Mr. President, Let us bring ourselves closer to the problem. As a global family, it is time that we own the problem. So together, let us take a human right-centered approach to the climate crisis. Let us focus on saving lives and livelihoods while we still have the slightest bit of time on our side. We can always recover from financial crises, including those caused by pandemics, and we have demonstrated that. But these are nothing compared to the economic costs we face when the social fabric of societies is torn asunder as lands become uninhabitable resulting in uncontrolled migration and widespread forced climate displacement. In Tuvalu, we are already living the future impacts of climate change now. Consequently, soft adaptation approaches, such as nature-based solutions, help, but, at 1.9 meters above sea level, they will not save Tuvalu from sea level rise. Tuvalu urgently needs adaptation measures based on building physical infrastructure to save ourselves. We are investing in building raised reclamation lands to preserve our physical existence as a viable state. This is our utmost priority now. There is no point in investing in soft and piecemeal adaptation measures when we are losing our land territory at an alarming rate.  Easy access to adequate and predictable climate finance is critical and we urge developed economies to raise their commitments under the Paris Agreement to mobilize US$100 billion for climate finance and constructively discuss a new finance goal for post 2025 that takes its floor at US$100 billion and that is based on science. Beyond this, we must also strive to bring climate finance into the development paradigm. We must recognize that the finance needs of developing countries are much higher than what is being provided and mobilized and ensure that climate finance is clearly defined to guarantee that it is effective and meets the needs of all LDCs and Pacific SIDS. Tuvalu appreciates the funding assistance it has received to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis and sincerely hopes to strengthen genuine and durable partnerships with our development partners. However, we must dismantle our current thinking about climate finance and rebuild our approach. Adaptation must be country led, efficient, and unencumbered. We can no longer adhere to strict rules and controls that leave climate finance beyond our reach and that stop us from pursuing bold, long-term adaptation priorities. Targeted and appropriate capacity building and enhanced access to and transfer of the most viable and applicable technology is also critical for SIDS, and more attention must be paid to the technology and capacity needs of these countries. "
320,"the 21st century unless deep reductions in emissions occur today. Right now, 40% of the central not predicted, future measures; this is the reality we are living with today. We cannot wait; we must make bold decisions and take firm action to secure our future.   Mr. President, We must conclude negotiations on the Paris Rulebook and safeguard the integrity of the Paris Agreement by stopping measures that will stall progress on its objectives.  We therefore urge global major emitters to commit to stronger climate action and to formulate mid-century long-term low emissions development strategies. The success of this COP depends entirely on the commitment of you, the global major emitters, and your readiness to help. The least developed countries and small island developing states are looking to you for you have the means to help and the moral responsibility to do so. Furthermore, you have the technology and the resources to save us.  Mr. President,   I travelled thousands of miles and through many transit points over 4 days to be here because I trust and have faith in international cooperation and multilateralism. For losing faith and trust is to accept the total demise of my country to sea level rise.  My country has an average land elevation of 1.9 meters above sea level. The science is predicting our total submersion due to sea level rise within this century. This is a fate not unique to Tuvalu but similar to that predicted for other atoll nations and low-lying coastal areas supporting millions of lives and livelihoods.   Mr. President, I have faith in our collective humanity and our ability to achieve global solidarity to undertake urgent climate change action NOW so that my country, Tuvalu, can have time to adapt and save ourselves. I am not asking for anything new. What I am asking for is what the Paris Agreement is demanding from the international community, and particularly, from those of us who have the capacity and the resources to contribute to global efforts to curb climate change. Mr. President, Global solidarity is central to addressing the climate crisis for the climate crisis is a global problem. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. It is wreaking havoc everywhere. Places that were once considered safe are no longer so. But climate impacts are only increasing in frequency and severity. Are we content to create for our children and their children a future of constant fear "
321,Tuvalu National Statement for the World Leaders Summit Honourable Prime Minister Kausea Natano
322,"Mr. President, Heads of Government,  Leaders, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen."
323,"I first wish to express my profound gratitude to the Government and People of the United Kingdom for the kind hospitality accorded to my delegation. We are gathered here at the beginning of negotiations for COP26a COP marked not only by clear evidence of the increasingly dire impacts of climate change and sea level rise but also by a far-flung pandemic that has again and again demonstrated the interconnected nature of our global community. What we do at home reverberates around the world, reminding us of our collective responsibility to address climate change for the well-being of humanity. This COP must be a COP of action! We must act now to ensure that all States recognize their shared responsibility to protect the global community and to ensure that all States are held accountable for this responsibility. We must lead the charge to develop global norms, practices, and meaningful changes to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Tuvalu wishes to reaffirm the critical urgency of the climate change crisis facing Pacific SIDS despite our negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. We urge World Leaders to similarly affirm the critical urgency of this crisis. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, declining marine resources, rising food insecuritythese are the alarming and detrimental consequences of climate changethe single greatest threat to our Pacific livelihoods, security, and welfare.  Mr. President, Despite the call made by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in 2019 through the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Action Now to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, I want to make it plainly clear that, even if all GHG emissions ceased tomorrow, Tuvalu, and other low-lying atoll nations, are sinking and our land is fast disappearing.  Under all current emissions scenarios considered, global surface temperatures will continue to increase until at least the mid-century. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during "
324,"of the Sea (ITLOS) on the legal responsibility of States for carbon emissions, marine pollution, and rising sea levels. We must support initiatives of this nature to develop and implement fair and just global and environmental norms and practices, including compensation for loss and damage. Mr. President, The impacts of climate change are affecting the entire world including the Republic of China (Taiwan), and Taiwan continues to effectively contribute to global efforts in combating the impacts of climate change through renewable energy innovations, national policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and providing support for countries like Tuvalu that are at the forefront of climate change. To truly and fully address the impacts of climate change, we must welcome the meaningful participation of Taiwan in the activities of the UNFCCC. For atoll nations, the ravages of sea level rise will defeat all of our efforts and development gains with regard to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Current global mitigation commitments and promises will not save us. For atoll nations like Tuvalu, we urgently require the means to build raised reclamation land to save ourselves. All other adaptation measures are secondary and should come only after we have secured the continued physical existence of our land territory despite the effects of sea level rise."

327," IGAD statement at United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021 COP 26/CMP 16/CMA 3 Glasgow, United Kingdom, 31 October  12 November 2021  By Dr Workneh Gebeyehu, Executive Secretary of IGAD Mr. President, Excellencies; Distinguished Delegates:"
328,"I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which is one of regional economic blocks in Africa constituted by 8 member states. I thank the Government and the people of the United Kingdom for hosting the UN Climate Change Conference and for the warm hospitality extended to my delegation. The IGAD region which is home to over 250 million people is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change. It is one of regions in the world where extreme climatic impacts have resulted into loss of lives and damage to properties. Frequent and intense drought and floods, unpredictable rainfall patterns, high temperature variability, food insecurity and water scarcity have become common in the region.  The recent IPCC report and its findings are welcomed especially on rising global temperature and impacts that is already felt in the IGAD region. It is our collective responsibility to save the planet. Taking into account the scale and gravity of the climate challenge, we all need to do more and act on now. We therefore join in the call for the widest possible cooperation by all actors and their commitment in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions. Mr. President; IGAD has developed a regional climate change strategy that would provide a framework for integrated and coordinated mechanisms that will guide the Member States in addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities associated with climate change in the IGAD region. This strategy will require international support to be fully implemented.  IGAD through its specialized climate institution plays key role to address climate change challenge more so in the provision of high-quality data, scientific information, knowledge, decision support tools, early warning, capacity building and policy advice. There is need for such institutions to be supported to have access to funding so as to realize its role of strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of the IGAD region to climate change and extreme weather events through the promotion of integrated and sustainable development across a wide-range of sectors of the economy and society. In conclusion IGAD calls for urgent action at all levels be it individual, local, national regional and global to avoid dangerous climate change."

330," 1 Remarks By H.E. General Prayuth Chan-o-Cha, Prime Minister of Thailand At the World Leaders Summit of the Twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26), Sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 16), and Third session of the Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 3) "
331,"Glasgow, Scotland"
332,"Mr. President,  Excellencies,"
333,"1. I am here todayto underscore the utmost importance that Thailand attaches to the problem of climate change.  We are prepared to collaborate with every nation, and every sector, to reach our common goal of solving the gravest challenge of our time.  This is a matter of life and death for our world, and the future of our children."
334,"2. At present, the amount of Green House Gas (GHG) emitted by Thailand is about 0.72 percent of the total global emissions.  However, Thailand is one of the ten countries most severely affected by the atmospheric degradation. It was why I participated in the Paris Climate Change Conference in 2015, and Thailand was among the first group of nations that ratified the Paris Agreement."
335," 3. Our commitments are not just empty words.  We have fulfilled every single pledge we made to the international community, fully and unremittingly.  Meanwhile, we have also taken active actions at the national level."
336,"4. Under the framework of the UNFCCC, Thailand set our NAMA goal to reduce the GHG from the energy and transport sectors at least 7% by the year 2020.  However, in 2019, we were able to reduce the GHG by 17% which more than doubled the targeted level, and more than one year ahead of schedule."
337,"5. Moreover, Thailand was among the first nations to submit the revised NDC to reduce the GHG emissions, and put in place plans at both national and local levels.  Also, Thailand was among the first nations to submit the Long-Term Low GHG Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) in line with the Paris Agreement.  This demonstrates our seriousness as a contributing partner in the fight against climate change."
338,"6. gness to be more aggressive in addressing the climate change challenges in every way and every means possible, by aiming at reaching carbon neutrality in 2050, and Net Zero GHG Emissions in or before 2065.  With the adequate, timely and equitable support of technology transfer and cooperation, and most importantly, the availability of and access to ample green financing facilities, Thailand can increase our NDC to 40%, and reach the Net Zero GHG Emissions in 2050. "
339, 2
340,"7. As a forward-looking strategy, Thailand has declared the Bio-Circular-Green economy model or BCG as our national agenda.  It is a paradigm shift that leads to eco-friendly economic growth. This model is the main agenda of the APEC meeting that Thailand is hosting next year."
341,"8. In parting, I would like to point out that time is running out, and we can no longer afford to be complacent in combatting climate change, for it means the end of the world as we know it.  This is a war that man can join hands, not to destroy one another, but to fight against a common enemy we ourselves created, and to right the wrong we inflicted upon this planet called earth.  Now the earth has spoken that enough is enough. The stakes are high; the ecosystem that puts food on our table, the water we drink, and the air we breathe must be preserved.  It is the task that demands immense valor, persistence and wisdom.  The ultimate beneficiary of our victory is our children.  For all of us, there is simply no lan B, because Planet B that is a substitute for the one we now call home."
342,Thank you.
343, 
344,Holy See
345,"Excellency,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  I have the honor of read an excerpt of the Message of Pope Francis, addressed to the President of this Conference."
346,"We can achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement only if we act in a coordinated and responsible way. Those goals are ambitious, and they can no longer be deferred.  Today it is up to you to take the necessary decisions."
347,"We are facing an epochal change that calls for commitment on the part of all, particularly those countries possessed of greater means. These countries need to take a leading role."
348,"For its part, the Holy See has adopted a strategy of net-zero emissions operating on two levels: 1) the commitment of Vatican City State to achieve this goal by 2050; and 2) the commitment of the Holy See to promote education in integral ecology to favour a cultural model of development and of sustainability centred on fraternity and on the covenant between human beings and the natural environment."
349,"Along these same lines, on 4 October last, I joined a number of religious leaders and scientists in signing a Joint Appeal in view of COP26.  What clearly emerged was a remarkable convergence on the urgent need for a change of direction, a decisive resolve to pass from the its inhabitants, now and in the future. Humanity possesses the wherewithal to effect this change. Especial care must likewise be related to commercial imbalances with environmental repercussions and to the disproportionate some ways the issue of foreign debt, the burden of which often hinders the development of peoples.   [We can and must restart from a consideration of all these aspects, along with the setting in place of carefully negotiated procedures for forgiving foreign debt, linked to a more sustainable and just economic restructuring aimed at meeting the climate emergency.]  "
350,"Sadly, we must acknowledge how far we remain from achieving the goals set for tackling climate change.  This cannot continue!  There is no time to waste.  All too many of our brothers and sisters are suffering from this climate crisis.  Now is the time to act, urgently, courageously and responsibly.  "
351,"The young, who in recent years have strongly urged us to act, will only inherit the planet we choose to leave to them, based on the concrete choices we make today.  Now is the moment for decisions that can provide them with reasons for hope and trust in the future."
352,I accompany you with my prayers as you take these important decisions.
353,Thank you 
354,"Ladies and gentlemen We are gathered at this global climate meeting, the most significant one since the historic Paris conference. We agreed in Paris to keep global warming within safe limits, and to upgrade our national contributions as needed for that purpose. That time has now come. We have received new guidance from science and the evidence is stronger. Our combined Paris pledges will not suffice. We need to upgrade.  Iceland announced last year an upgrade of our ambition level, from 40 to 55 per cent emissions cuts to 2030. We will achieve this goal in cooperation with the EU and its Member States and with Norway.  Earlier this year the Icelandic Parliament made our previously announced goal of carbon neutrality by 2040 legally binding. Iceland is one of few countries that has taken this step. We are working on a roadmap to carbon neutrality; a big step on that journey is our newly released Long-Term Low Emission Strategy, in line with the Paris Agreement. Iceland has set a goal of quitting fossil fuel use by 2050. Last September, Iceland published its first adaptation strategy.  The parties who are now forming a new government in Iceland are currently discussing ways to strengthen our 2030 target while ensuring a just transition towards a greener economy. In climate mitigation, we believe we are on the right track, but we want to do better still. As part of its renewed NDC, Iceland has increased its year-on-year funding for climate related development programs and projects significantly and continues to do so. "
355,"Ladies and gentlemen, Targets are important, but action is essential. We know what we need to do. We need energy conservation and renewables to replace planet-cooking fossil fuels. We need to stop devouring forests and wetlands that are valuable carbon sinks and bastions of biodiversity. We need to scale up on tested clean solutions, and we need green technology and innovation. We need civil society and all sectors to contribute, but governments have to lead the way."
356,In Iceland we have some good stories to tell: 100% renewable energy for heating and electricity; second in the world in the share of clean cars in total 
357,"sales. This is because governments made wise decisions in the past and this is what governments need to keep on doing. But we need to do more. We need clean energy transition to extend to ships and airplanes. We must do better in nature-based solutions. In Iceland we have doubled our efforts in the last three years or so. But we need to redouble them, at least.  We must look for negative emissions and new technology. Just two months agoThe CO2 is being pumped in the basalt ground where it is petrified. We hope this is a small first step towards something bigger. Ladies and gentlemen, Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you will know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day. These are the words of an Icelandic author, Magnason. And his words are true: The time to create the future is now, today. Young people are pressing for actions; we must heed their call. I also want to underscore the importance of gender equality in our discourse. We must involve women and girls in all aspects of climate action and decisions  we need the energy and ingenuity of all of humankind.  The signs of climate disruption are ominous, we see emergencies around the world that are a direct consequence of the climate crisis. In Iceland we see our glaciers receding. We worry about the change of chemistry and circulation in our oceans in ways that could disrupt the entire marine ecosystem.  But there are also signs of progress, that give ground for hope and optimism. The promise of the Paris Agreement is alive and well. I sense great ambition and will here in Glasgow. There is demanding work ahead, but it can be good work as well. Green transition can and must be the growth story of the 21st Century, and save the day  and the planet."

360, Climate Change can not be wished away by throwing pennies into the Trevi fountain nor by announcing net zero scams pushing into 2070.
361,Climate change is about action today and can no longer afford futuristic IOUs.
362,This has to be the decisive decade for de-carbonization and nature positive development.  
363,"The silver linings of this process are not found in this room but on the sidelines  the Pavilion Zone - where the private sector initiatives are gaining ground, the technologies becoming available and affordable and some new innovative financial mechanisms like pushing new frontiers. Pakistan is actively engaged with all this out of the box thinking and this is really what gives hope that a new world is possible. "

369,"Even though we are not a major contributor, we continue to be on the top ten list of most vulnerable countries for 10 straight years now  this puts uontinuously impacted the front lines - braving disastrous floods, unlivable heatwaves and bursting glaciers."
370,This climate injusticeis the gravest human rights violation of history where the lives and livelihoods of billions of people are at risk  all due to the unbridled pollution and uncontrolled excesses of a few.
371,The forced climate adaptation needs remain at between $7 to $14 billion per annum and almost 70% of these fall in the loss and damage category. This Adaptation finance is forced upon us today and presents a simple choice - between life and death.
372,"Mr President, "
373,"The galaxy of world leaders who gathered here last week, unfortunately failed to live up to the expectations of the world and rise to the reality of the grave challenge we face.  "
374,4
375,We have dropped our emissions 9% below BAU in 2020 and have developed a pathway to reach 15% below BAU by 2030 utilizing our own resources  I repeat our own resources. 
376,"However, we have also thrown a conditional challenge to the world. Deliver us the climate finance of a $100 bn over the next decade and we will drop our emissions to 50% below BAU."
377,"With less than 1% of the global emissions, Pakistan is certainly not a part of the problem of climate change. However, we have chosen to be a part of the solution. Our NDC shows what is possible if a clear climate vision and strategic planning get positively aligned. The World Bank recently affirmed that 44% of our mainstream development finance is on a climate friendly pathway and it is the highest for any country in the world."
378,We are not just talking - but walking the talk on climate change. 
379,Can this room also walk the talk on climate finance  currently overpromised and under delivered?

400,26th Session of Conference of Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

402,"  Excellency Mr Alok Sharma , President of COP 26 Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen."
403,"Mr President, "
404,Let me take this opportunity to thank the Government and people of United Kingdom for successfully hosting the conference in the beautiful city of Glasgow. 
405,The ongoing COVID crisis has taught us two very important lessons. 
406,"Firstly  that we can not fight nature and hope to win. The COVID pandemic, biodiversity crisis and the climate calamity are all manifestations of a losing battle.  "
407,7
408,It is time to stop playing jokes with Climate Change. We will most certainly not have the last laugh on this. 
409,It is time to change course so let us make that happen here at Glasgow.
410,Let us not become the dinosaurs who refused to change.
411,I thank you.
412,
413,"Mr President, Honorable Heads of State and Government, Honorable Ministers, Ladies and gentlemen,"
414,"It is an honor to be here, representing Brazil, at this important Conference of the Parties in Glasgow. I thank, on behalf of our delegation, for the kind reception and I congratulate the COP26 team for the organization. In our case, this effort was mutual, because Brazil also received Glasgow. We set up an interactive structure and promoted the participation of 10 ministers of state, connected in real time to our pavilion here in Glasgow, demonstrating the integrated action of the Brazilian government in the international climate agenda. Thus, it was also possible to present cases of a real Brazil in several panels."
415,"This is part of a greater effort, with already clear outcomes. Brazil, as a key player in the negotiations, made important moves during the first days and we announced even more ambitious climate targets: 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050; eliminate illegal deforestation by 2028; and support the global methane reduction. We proactively gave clear signs that Brazil is part of the solution to overcome this global challenge to reduce emissions."
416,"Brazil is gigantic by nature, so our actions reflect the proportions of our territory and our people. Our low-carbon agriculture has already restored nearly 28 million hectares of degraded pastures and will increase this number to 58 million by 2030; we have the world's largest biofuels operational program, our renewable energies contribute to 84% of our electricity matrix, generating a record of 380 thousand jobs in solar and wind; we have 16 million hectares of native forests in recovery; and our solid waste management program has already reduced the number of dumpsites by 20%."
417,"We particularly highlight the Águas Brasileiras Program, which aims to plant 100 million trees in the Cerrado, Pantanal and Caatinga biomes. Also, the New Basic Sanitation Framework, which gives the opportunity for the private sector to provide wastewater treatment to over 100 million people. Also, the incredible transformation from the logistical modal to railroads, with more than 5,000 km of new rails, representing a 75% reduction in emissions of GEE in cargo transport and equating the Brazilian modal to that of developed countries. Results like these demonstrate the strength of the current and real Brazilian environmental policy."
418,"But the Government of Brazil wants more. Less than a month ago, we launched the foundations of the National Green Growth Program, to give priority to green initiatives, whether public or private, aimed at reducing emissions, forest conservation and rational use of natural resources, hence contributing to the generation of green jobs. The program already includes resources from federal banks in the order of 50 billion dollars."
419,"We recognize our challenges and have been working to overcome them. To contain illegal deforestation in the Amazon, the Federal Government doubled the resources "
420,"allocated to federal environmental agencies and is going to hire 739 new environmental agents. In addition, the Ministry of Justice collaborates with 700 men in the field, working in 23 municipalities in an ostensible and permanent way. The Ministry of Defense, through Censipam, recently launched an innovative and even more accurate forest monitoring system."
421,"We also recognize that where there is a lot of forest there is also a lot of poverty. And, to promote sustainable development in the region, we created the National Program for Payments for Environmental Services Floresta+, which seeks to promote the market for environmental services, recognizing and providing payments to those who take care of the forest."
422,"At this COP and even long before we get here, our Delegation has been working to achieve positive results in creating a global carbon market under Article 6, understanding Brazil's role in building bridges between the different parties and its potential as an exporter of carbon credits, contributing to a more balanced global reduction."
423,"It is important that developed countries recognize the financial emergency and mobilize the necessary resources to achieve the desired goals at this conference. The $100 billion target was not met and currently this figure is no longer sufficient for the world to build a new green economy with a responsible transition. More ambitious volumes are needed, with easy access and agile execution, so that the transformation takes place in an inclusive way in each territory around the world, mainly in regions that are more vulnerable in terms of climate and economic development."
424,"The countries that are historically and currently responsible for the largest volumes of emissions must demonstrate their effective funding ambitions at this conference, without further postponing a commitment made in 2015 and so far, not fully realized."
425,"All parties of this conference must take on their common but differentiated responsibilities towards a green economy neutral in emissions. The global challenge to be overcome is to revert the negative logic of punishment, sanction and prohibition to the positive logic of incentive, innovation and prioritization. It is necessary to transform the environmental agenda into an opportunity to generate green jobs. Based on a constructive vision, we will find the way to create the sustainable future we all want."
426,The Green Future has already started in Brazil.
427,Thank you very much.

429,"    Statement on behalf of the European Union and its Member States  Page 1 of 2  STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES Opening Plenary of the Ministerial Segment of COP26 Glasgow, 9 November 2021   Statement delivered by mr. Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Commission Dear friends, The first week of our conference has been characterised by promising declarations and great promises by our leaders. And also by great work by the Presidency and by Patricia and her team. And I do appreciate everything that's been done by delegations and negotiators so far. But the honest truth is that we are not where we need to be. Not even close. We are moving in the right direction, yes, but the world is still too far away from our 1.5 degree goal. This week, before we leave this conference, we need to make sure that we take decisions that put us on track to reaching our goal. And this needs to be done within a year, because time is running out. This is about addressing the effects of the crisis that we are already in. It's not just about preventing things getting even worse. We need to really realise that today is the day we need to act, on adaptation as well. Financing adaptation is critical. We all repeated that mantra endlessly. But the rhetoric, sadly, is not followed by action. We all need to get cracking and we all need to do it now. That is why the European Commission will contribute •100 million to the Adaptation Fund. Because those who need resources for adaptation, also need to have predictability and clarity about its delivery. To the Parties pushing for more ambition I say this: You will find the EU on your side. To the Parties stopping and stalling progress, I say: What are you waiting for? Science tells us we are out of time. Extreme weather events show us the consequences, everywhere on our planet. To everyone here I say: Let's overcome our differences and find solutions this week. COP26 is not a place for disagreement and narrow mindedness. "
430,"    Statement on behalf of the European Union and its Member States  Page 2 of 2 COP26 must be where we work together and succeed together. It's time! Thank you.  Statement delivered by mr. Andrej Vizjak, Minister for the Environment and Spatial Planning of the Republic of Slovenia Dear President, Distinguished Ministers, Colleagues,  Firstly, I would like to thank UK Presidency for all their efforts so far IPCC report clearly shows that global warming can only be limited to 1.5°C, if strong and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are undertaken. Collectively we need to urgently step up global climate mitigation ambition in the near term, well ahead of 2030. We have heard strong and clear voices by civil society, especially the youth, that more ambitious climate action is needed. And now in Glasgow we have the opportunity to demonstrate that we have responded to their message. The EU is fully committed to work in this direction. We need to come to a clear, comprehensive and balanced outcome which will ensure an ambitious global response to climate change, keeping the 1.5 °C goal within reach, in line with the best available science.  We would like to conclude on robust Article 6 rules which must avoid double counting and ensure environmental integrity.  Concluding on arrangements under the enhanced transparency framework, which is the backbone of a well-functioning Paris Agreement, is a key element.   reaching a consensus on common time frame for all Parties to be fully aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition cycle.   continuing discussion on setting the new post-2025 collective goal on climate finance in light of making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards a low emission, recognizing the needs of developing countries.  Continuing the discussion on the Global Goal on Adaptation and advancing work ok loss and damage  EU firmly believes that only international engagement through strong rule-based multilateralism and human rights-based approach including through the Global Climate Action Agenda, will enable us to achieve successful results in addressing climate change. Colleagues, ministers, our responsibility for achieving goals of the Paris Agreement is a shared commitment.  We need to substantially increase mitigations efforts, scale up adaptation measures and increase the mobilisation of climate finance.   "
431,"Statement by EMBL Director General to COP26 The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) is Europe's only intergovernmental organisation for life science research, enabling scientific collaboration and endeavour across Europe and beyond.  We are well placed to coordinate the synergies of science and policy. During the past year, pioneering developments in life sciences, particularly in the field of molecular biology, have been implemented in the global fight against COVID-19 and have delivered solutions that have proven to be vital for human health.  As was the case with tackling Covid-19, life sciences research and innovation have the potential to generate novel, bio-based solutions that can also be vital tools in the fight against climate change and environmental damage.  Scientific research is essential in developing new knowledge and innovations to mitigate the impact of human action on the natural world and, furthermore, give us evidence-based insight into the current condition of life on earth."
432,"To be truly effective in finding solutions to the multi-layered problems brought about by climate change, scientists, industries and policymakers will be required to work differently, across disciplines, and to embrace new technologies. "
433,Several decades of foundational research can be leveraged to create near-term solutions that can be scaled up whereas other research areas that are relatively new may provide solutions in the long-term. Timely investments in research to understand the molecular basis of damaging changes in the environment will be crucial to mitigate the risks of climate change.
434,I call upon the Conference of the Parties to commit to ensure molecular biology is enabled to achieve its full potential to address the climate crisis  we must not miss this crucial opportunity.

437, THE PHILIPPINES NATIONAL STATEMENT FOR THE COP 26 MEETING
438,"Carlos G. Dominguez Secretary of Finance Chairman-Designate, Climate Change Commission November 9, 2021"
439,The Philippines is determined to be a world leader in this fight against climate change. 
440,"We account only for three-tenths of one percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, we bear the brunt of the consequences of climate change. Our country is sinking at a rate four times faster than the global average. Annually, we are confronted with increasingly severe typhoons, floods, and droughts. Millions of lives are at stake. Clearly, climate change is very real to the Philippines."
441,"To challenge ourselves and the rest of the world, we set the boldest national goal put Philippines commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent in 2030.  "
442,We are moving ahead with urgency to fulfill our ambitious target. We shifted from theorizing about climate change to executing practical climate adaptation and mitigation projects on the ground. We have put together a group of Filipino experts who represent all corners of the Philippines to engage our fishermen and farmers and prepare them to execute localized action plans. 
443,We just launched our Sustainable Finance Roadmap to deploy the engines of finance to get green projects moving across our archipelago. To urge the Filipino people to law banning single-use plastics. We launched a partnership with the Asian Development Bank for a landmark project that will accelerate our transition from coal to clean energy. This comes after President Duterte declared a moratorium on new coal plants a year ago.
444,"These are concrete actions to demonstrate to the world how a developing and climate-vulnerable country like the Philippines can lead in this fight to save our planet. This also shows that our commitments are not merely empty or half-baked promises, but are supported by actionable projects on the ground.  "
445,
446,FINAL We have very high expectations for this COP 26 to become not just merely an annual platform for discussion but a catalyst for concrete action plans. 
447,"climate justice. Those who have polluted and continue to pollute the Earth's environment through unthinking industrialization starting 200 years ago must pay for the grants, investments, and subsidies needed for the most vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change."
448,The time for debate is over. This is the time to finally begin acting on the fulfillment of our commitments and obligations to humanity.

491,"STATEMENT BY H. E. STEFAN YANEV, PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA"
492,"Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is an honor to address the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I would like to thank the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for organizing this forum in extremely difficult times of global pandemic and to express my strong appreciation to the President of COP 26 Mr. Alok Sharma for the constructive dialogue involving all stakeholders. The last IPCC1 report contains scientific evidences that the more frequent extreme weather events, we are witnessing across the planet, are a clear sign that the planetary warming is accelerating and is already affecting many aspects of our lives, economies and ecosystems. Our presence here today means that we realize how important it is to work together and that more credible actions are needed by all countries and by every one of us to limit the temperature rising."
493,1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
494,"In this context, Bulgaria is completely determined to fulfill its commitments to the Paris Agreement. Along with the other EU member states Bulgaria will work for reaching the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and for the more ambitious goal of 55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, which is enshrined in the EU legislation. At a national level, we have developed an entirely new set of measures in our Recovery and Resilience Plan. It will become a new roadmap for decarbonisation of the Bulgarian industry, and for reaching economic growth within a sustainable and preserved environment, which includes phasing out of coal use by 2038 - 2040. Our efforts are focused on three main goals: accelerated further development of renewable energy sources and hydrogen; increase of the energy efficiency of the economy, and sustainable mobility. All the measures that will lead to the green transition are carried out in the economic reality of today - the reality of an unprecedented pandemic and rising energy prices. Our main concern is the risk of job losses and the energy security of our country as we believe that only a performing and vital economy can be transformed. Therefore, the national features should be taken into account for a fair and proportionate approach. Bulgaria supports the united efforts of governments, private sector, academia and other stakeholders in our common goal to fight climate change. No country alone is able to face the global threat of climate change, because we  have the option or luxury of failure. Let us join in our efforts to reach a new consensus among all countries on the necessary climate actions and goals to achieve global climate neutrality by mid-century as well as to agree on decisive short- and medium-term policies based on the right balance between mitigation and adaptation."

With 86% of our energy generation coming from solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear and example of one of the lowest carbon emissions per unit. We intend to maintain this leadership by introducing blue and green hydrogen and promoting the use this new fuel through the economy."
500,At the same time our Government Strategy is pursuing the goal of finding and maintaining a balance between policies aimed at addressing climate challenges and reaching sustainable development goals to continue economic growth and improvement of living standard of our people.

504,In October 2021 the Russian Government has adopted a new 2050 Strategy of Social and Economic Development with Low Greenhouse Gas Emission. This strategy outlines measures that by 2050 compared to 1990 will bring our country to an 80% net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while maximizing absorbing capacity of our forests and other ecosystems. It also outlines low greenhouse gas emission development measures until 2050.
505,"To achieve these ambitious objectives, we are focusing on improving our forest management practices, enhancing wildland fire prevention and response capabilities, preserving and increasing wilderness areas, introducing new farming practices as well as engaging in transformation towards cleaner energy. Our energy companies are implementing low emission technologies to ensure production, delivery and distribution of cleaner fuel to consumers. Our regions started pilot projects that "

507,earlier. The success depends on availability of new technologies and funds to finance this transition.
508, Through history human ingenuity has always led to finding solutions to the most complex issues. We are confident that this time humanity will also develop solutions that will bring a better future. Climate change requires all countries to work together and share knowledge and tools.
509," Therefore, there should be no discrimination or restrictions preventing countries from accessing and using technologies and financing tools that will facilitate development of new sustainable infrastructure, capture and storage, decarbonization, improvement of energy efficiency, and support transition to clean energy. And if someone will be hampering this all of us would know who should be blamed for failing to reach climate goals.     "
510,"International efforts are also critical for enhancing cooperation in areas of ecosystem management, developing and improving monitoring and reporting emission and absorption practices as well as measuring progress in meeting climate goals. It is "
511,"Your Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
512,Addressing global warming and prevention of climate change depends on the ability of all nations to set aside differences and join together in resolving these challenges. 
513,"Russia is mostly a northern country. Yet we are facing negative impacts of global warming including increase of desert areas, soil erosion, forest fires, floods and melting of permafrost. We take these matters seriously and responsibly. "
514,"As you might be well aware the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia will reach carbon neutrality by 2060. This promise is based on a comprehensive approach covering not only the problems of controlling and decreasing emission but also managing and improving greenhouse gas absorbing capabilities of our natural ecosystems including forests, tundra, farmland, marshes and seas."
515,Taking a promise of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 does not mean that Russia is refraining from achieving this goal 
516, 6
517,climate change should not lead to further increase of poverty. Not just in the developing but in the developed world as well.
518," Transition to new economy should be based on an equilibrium where investment returns and long-term asset value increase will be balanced by reliable energy supply that meets growing energy demand as well as the goals of reduction and absorption of greenhouse gas emissions. The solution of this equilibrium will determine the living standard of our descendants. This is a new economic balance that all of us will need to find together.    And while this will be happening, at the time of these enormous changes, Russia will remain a reliable supplier of energy to international markets and consumers."

522,"    26th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) Glasgow (United Kingdom) October 31st - November 12th, 2021    Dear delegates, Refrigeration preserves food and health, and is essential to human life. However, the quality of the cold chain can vary from country to country tremendously; in some countries it is almost entirely absent. This has consequences for food security, for the preservation of health products such as vaccines, and for the health of the population: poor nutrition, disease and death. The IIR attempted to estimate food losses due to a lack of refrigeration in a note published in 2020: out of 3630 Mt produced, 47% should benefit from refrigeration, but only less than half of this really is refrigerated. These losses (13% of the food produced) could theoretically feed 950 million people per year, 1/3 of the future needs due to population growth and undernourishment. Extending the cold chain would also help the environment: food losses generate CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions and use additional soil and water. We compared the impact of CO2 eq emissions from food losses to CO2 eq emissions of a cold chain at the level of developed countries worldwide. Such an extended cold chain would generate only half the emissions due to food perishing, so overall the cold chain is an environmental gain! Of course, with the technological improvements on energy and refrigerants already available, the results could have been much better. For food security, public health and climate change reasons, the implementation of a sustainable cold chain should be a priority for each country and should be included in Nationally Determined Contributions. The IIR is already involved in various projects in developing countries with United Nations agencies and programmes and some developed countries.  The IIR is available to assist you.  Thank you. "

528,"We have embarked upon ambitious plans to reduce emissions and build climate resilience, but we will need help. These measures include the following:"
529,"        We are in the process of establishing the largest utility-scale solar renewable energy project in the Caribbean with a capacity of 112 megawatts, accounting for 10% of our power needs, and we plan to increase this complement to 30% by 2030;"
530,       We have developed an e-mobility policy and we are already implementing measures to phase-in electric vehicles. 
531, 4 COP26 will be a critical point at which we can assess whether our climate finance flows are headed in the right direction.
532,"In this regard, the US announcement that it would double its climate finance support, is particularly inspiring. This is the type of bold action all donor countries need to consider in the weeks ahead The mobilization of private finance will also be critical for securing the urgently needed investment, particularly for the transformation of our energy sectors."
533," Mr. President, we must complete the work to implement the Enhanced Transparency Framework.    Even as a small country with limited resources, we will make every effort to report to the required standard, with some assistance, of course. We expect others to do the same. This is the deal we made in Paris."

562,Countries that have profited the most from carbon over decades have a responsibility to provide others with resources and technology to transition to low carbon economies. This was the basis of the US$100 billion a year pledge from developed countries at the Copenhagen COP in 2009.  We need a renewed commitment to this pledge.
563,"Allow me to strongly emphasize that without developed countries meeting this pledge, our national efforts at climate resilience and low carbon development are simply unachievable.  "
564,"If we are to have any realistic chance of meeting our climate ambitions, we need financing that is predictable, less fragmented, and easier to access. For Small Island Developing States, with miniscule carbon footprints, the greater need for funding is for protection and recovery from disasters as well as for climate adaptation."

We aim to set ambitious goals for each of the dimensions of the Plan, which we believe are realistic to be achieved by 2030, and which will enable further development of the energy sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina. "
584,"I would like to emphasize that within the development of the National Energy and Climate Plan, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also working on the development of a Coal Region Transition Road Map. Such transition of the coal regions and the entire energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina has to be a fair one. It must provide for the switch from coal to renewable energy sources without any loss of jobs."
585,"Regarding the energy sector, defining ways to finance the energy transition is of the utmost importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The energy transition will require significant investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. Bosnia and Herzegovina, like many other countries, will need substantial international financial assistance and support for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by 2050. Special focus must be on the planned closure of coal mines and the shutdown of coal-fired power plants."
586,"There is no doubt that Bosnia and Herzegovina wishes to contribute to the fight against climate change. However, we will not be able to do this alone. We need the support. We have to cooperate with the countries that can accelerate this process with their knowledge and resources. Regardless of the fact that I do not represent a country with a large population, it will be necessary for everyone to contribute to the efforts to stop climate change. You can certainly count on us.   "
587,"for ourselves. I am pleased to share with you today that Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in April this year, reaffirming its commitment to fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement.

588,"By submitting this document, Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes one of the first countries in the Western Balkans to adopt an updated NDC with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 33.2% by 2030 and almost 66% by 2050."
589,"In order to meet our goals of climate change prevention, we are also working to enable the transition to sustainability and creating an attractive environment for private sector investment in clean, affordable energy. We will need substantial international assistance in the areas of technology transfer and development of financial mechanisms to encourage decarbonisation. The same goes for financial support to the climate issues projects. With the goal of further decarbonisation of the energy sector, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Sofia Declaration on the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans in November 2020. BiH thus committed to work together with the EU to make Europe a climate-neutral continent by 2050. In that regard, one of our current most important activities is the development of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for the period 2021-2030 (NECP BiH). That document aligns multiple objectives: those of the European Union in the field of energy and climate, those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement and the Energy Community.

599,"Mr President, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,On behalf of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the UK government and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising this Conference and their excellent arrangement and warm hospitality. The COP26 comes at a critical time, as the world strives to recover from a harrowing pandemic that deeply hurt economies and downgraded the social condition of people, particularly in the most vulnerable regions. As a gathering of 18 major gas producers, globally representing more than 70% of the proven natural gas reserves, the GECF recognises the challenges taken by the international community to counter the environmental issues. The GECF Member Countries have placed climate action at the forefront of their priorities by focusing on exploration of all possible options Œ from technology and innovation to research and development Œ in order to cement the role of natural gas as a solution for a balanced energy transition. Our Environmental Knowledge and Solutions (EKS) framework has been initiated as a collaborative platform with designed measures to build capabilities and mitigation practices.  energy system, natural gas has won the battle of  narrative Œ on pure merit Œ and embedded itself in all important discussions currently taking place within the framework of the UNFCCC, G20, BRICS, the World Economic Forum, and other international fora. respective capabilities, which is well recognised by the UNFCCC framework. This principle is a key determinant from each country in relation to climate change.We consider that ensuring access to competitive and reliable energy sources is of paramount importance for a sustained economic recovery. There is a real need to look for the energy options that achieve the right balance between the post-COVID-19 economic and social requirements and the environmental constraints. Given technology™s pivotal role in transforming the industry, we recommend that the COP26 negotiations are underpinned by technology transfer to decarbonise the energy sector, including the decarbonisation technologies of the gas industry.

Sentyurin, Secretary GeneralAt the GECF, we do believe that natural gas, the cleanest hydrocarbon source, has a role to play in supporting a balanced energy transition. Natural gas not only enables an immediate reduction of emissions through its substitution to more carbon-intensive fuels, but also widens energy access, including through emerging solutions such as small-scale LNG. Natural gas is one of the global enablers steadfastly by replacing carbon-intensive fuels and backing up intermittent renewables. It also provides a competitive energy source due to its abundance and diversity of production centres and supply routes. All major energy scenarios that earnestly backcast the achievement of sustainable development goals signal an important role of natural gas in the global energy mix.

600,"Mr President, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,On behalf of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the UK government and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising this Conference and their excellent arrangement and warm hospitality. The COP26 comes at a critical time, as the world strives to recover from a harrowing pandemic that deeply hurt economies and downgraded the social condition of people, particularly in the most vulnerable regions. As a gathering of 18 major gas producers, globally representing more than 70% of the proven natural gas reserves, the GECF recognises the challenges taken by the international community to counter the environmental issues. The GECF Member Countries have placed climate action at the forefront of their priorities by focusing on exploration of all possible options Œ from technology and innovation to research and development Œ in order to cement the role of natural gas as a solution for a balanced energy transition. Our Environmental Knowledge and Solutions (EKS) framework has been initiated as a collaborative platform with designed measures to build capabilities and mitigation practices.  energy system, natural gas has won the battle of  narrative Œ on pure merit Œ and embedded itself in all important discussions currently taking place within the framework of the UNFCCC, G20, BRICS, the World Economic Forum, and other international fora. respective capabilities, which is well recognised by the UNFCCC framework. This principle is a key determinant from each country in relation to climate change.We consider that ensuring access to competitive and reliable energy sources is of paramount importance for a sustained economic recovery. There is a real need to look for the energy options that achieve the right balance between the post-COVID-19 economic and social requirements and the environmental constraints. Given technology™s pivotal role in transforming the industry, we recommend that the COP26 negotiations are underpinned by technology transfer to decarbonise the energy sector, including the decarbonisation technologies of the gas industry.

Sentyurin, Secretary GeneralAt the GECF, we do believe that natural gas, the cleanest hydrocarbon source, has a role to play in supporting a balanced energy transition. Natural gas not only enables an immediate reduction of emissions through its substitution to more carbon-intensive fuels, but also widens energy access, including through emerging solutions such as small-scale LNG. Natural gas is one of the global enablers steadfastly by replacing carbon-intensive fuels and backing up intermittent renewables. It also provides a competitive energy source due to its abundance and diversity of production centres and supply routes. All major energy scenarios that earnestly backcast the achievement of sustainable development goals signal an important role of natural gas in the global energy mix. Nevertheless, we take into account the rising pressure on the gas industry to reduce its emissions footprint, particularly following the release of the 6th IPCC Assessment Report (AR6-WG1), which pointed out the still worsening consequences of climate change.

633,"This event takes place at a critical time for humanity. As a developing tropical island nation with abundant biodiversity, Sri Lanka is deeply aware of the impacts of climate change.  Our rich philosophical heritage, shaped by s, places great value on environmental integrity. Sustainability is therefore at the heart of our national policy framework.  s aims to reduce emissions towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  We have prioritised enhancing national forest cover, with initiatives underway to increase our carbon sequestration capacity by 7% by 2030. We will increase contribution of renewable energy sources to 70% of national energy needs by 2030 and are taking steps to phase out use of fossil fuels.  Sri Lanka is also proud to be a co-lead of the Energy Compact for No New Coal Power.   Sri Lanka recently restricted imports of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and weedicides due to public health concerns, water contamination, soil degradation, and biodiversity impacts. Although opposed by entrenched lobbies, this has created opportunities for innovation and investment into organic agriculture that will be healthier and more sustainable in future. Reactive nitrogen emissions from overuse of artificial fertilizer is a major contributor to climate change. "

640,"Statement by Hon. Gennaro Migliore, President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (PAM) Excellencies, Distinguished guests, Dear Colleagues and friends, Ladies and gentlemen,"
641,"It is a privilege to contribute to this important conference on behalf of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean, an international parliamentary organization representing 34 national parliaments from the Euro-Mediterranean  and the Gulf regions, for which I have the honour to be its current president. We see some lights and shadows coming from this conference. However, we are deeply troubled by recent scientific reports on the impact of climate change, especially in our region, a climate sensitive area where more than 500 million people live. Efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees have already failed in the Mediterranean, where the tendency to overheat is 20% faster than in the rest of the world, and that could even increase from 2.2 to 3,8 degrees in the coming decades. Desertification, food insecurity, extreme weather conditions, shortage of drinking water, soil erosion, risks of new diseases, and climate refugees are not the setting for a film. These are the projections of our scientists. These effects are even particularly profound when they overlap with fragility and past or current conflicts. "
642,"The Paris Agreement must be respected in a responsible manner, with appropriate national laws, policies and regulations. We  urge developed countries and emerging economies to build coalitions to create the financial and technological conditions to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy as well as the phase out of coal. My organization and the 34 parliaments it represents are ready to do their part to ensure the implementation of international commitments. I thank you for your attention."

652,"At the outset, on behalf of the government of the Lao PDR, I would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Government of the United Kingdom, in partnership with Italy, for their great effort to host this meaningful Conference despite challenges caused by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic."
653,"Mr. President, The Lao PDR has attached great importance to combating climate change. We are committed to implement the Paris Agreement by incorporating its relevant provisions into our National Socio-Economic Development Plan and National Green Growth Strategy while promoting international cooperation and engagement of relevant stakeholders.  Early this year, the Lao government has revised our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that clearly outlines ambitious targets of the national actions for tackling and mitigating climate change toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. We have also set out lofty goals to achieve by 2030 which include, among others, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent, increasing forest cover to 70% of total land area, promoting increased use of renewable and clean energy through a 30% share of electric vehicles, 10% biofuel, and improving water management practices.  In order to translate our NDC into reality, there is a pressing need for adequate financial resources, including enhanced financial and technical support and assistance from the international community especially development partners. It is our firm belief that gaining access to climate finance and other sources of funding is crucial to supporting developing countries, especially LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS to achieve their development goals and commitments made under the Paris Agreement. "
654,"Mr. President,"
655,"Having recognized the paramount importance of promoting clean and renewable energy and the role of forest cover as a pathway to decouple greenhouse gas emissions, the government of Lao PDR has further initiated several measures and policies, including the recent announcement of policy on the use of electric vehicles, the allocation of 16.5 million hectares as forestland to increase forest cover as well as the plan to develop a 600-megawatt wind power plant which is the first cross-border electricity interchange from wind power generation in the region In addition, we have implemented the Safe Clean Climate Resilient Hospital Initiative to further promote low carbon environmentally sustainable technology as well as green procurement and supply. This is the first significant step by the health sector to begin developing plan for implementing low-carbon, resilient health care. Mr. President, "

671,"Developing countries, especially Africa including small states like Eswatini are ready to transform their economies, however, without the much needed adequate, predictable, and accessible financial support this remains an impossible task for us. We therefore emphasize the importance of the delivery of support for developing countries, including through the fulfilment of the developed country goal of jointly mobilizing US$100 billion per year by 2020 and annually through to 2025, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, and delivering a significant increase in finance for adaptation."
672," Mr. President, Eswatini continues to fully support the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and has submitted her enhanced and ambitious, updated National Determined Contributions (NDCs) which focus on all sectors. This is despite the fact that as a nation we contribute as little as 0.007% share to the Global GHG emissions. We call upon all Parties to be as transparent and communicate their new or updated NDCs of highest possible ambition, and long- term strategies that set out a pathway towards net zero in order to keep the targeted 1.5 degree Celsius objective of the Paris Agreement."

We therefore can expect that the SADC region will experience nor less than a 3 Celsius warming. This is happening amidst the extreme weather events already experienced such as heatwaves, floods and droughts. The warnings are clear that these events will dramatically increase in intensity and frequency over the coming years. The livelihoods of emaSwati depend heavily on agriculture, which suffered the drastic effects of Cyclone Eloise. Such extreme weather patterns have resulted in a dramatic decline in agricultural production."
679," Despite the restrictions caused by the COVID 19 Pandemic, Eswatini is taking bold action to address climate change, with significant national resources being allocated to adaptation and mitigation actions in a balanced approach. We understand the urgency of climate action and have adopted policies and programmes such as the National Climate Change Policy, National Development Strategy and the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Strategy which incorporate robust climate action. We have pledged to considerably raise investment in and access to renewable energy to the population by increasing the share of renewable energy to 50% in the electricity mix by 2030 relative to 2010 levels through the adoption of solar, wind, biomass, hydro, and solar water heater technologies."

740,"We see this, not only in extreme eventsfirestorms, flooding, deadly landslides. But we also see it in the inch-by-inch loss of healthy, essential environment, lands and waters that are the lifeblood of billions of people."
741,"The Middle East has been among the hardest-hit regions. In Jordan, reduced rainfalls and high evaporation have combined to a deadly effect. The Jordan River is a shadow of what the Bible and our forefathers depicted. The Dead Sea is dropping by more than half a metre a year. Freshwater aquifers are dwindling, and their salinity rising. All this compounds our extreme water scarcity, already under pressure because of massive refugee flows."
742,This is why Jordan is committed to the climate change fight.
743,"When Jordan joined the Paris Agreement in 2015, we set a target of a 14-percent carbon reduction by 2030. And now, we aim to double it over the next nine years, with your help."
744,"To achieve this, we have identified 32 emission-reduction projects, with a total cost of $7.6 billion dollars."
745,"The work has begun. Jordan has been a regional pioneer in renewable energy, clean mobility, and other green technologies. We have worked closely with the green-tech industry, and we welcome continued partnership. "
746," Numerous solar and wind projects are up and running. And this sector will continue to grow, as we plan to export electricity to neighbouring countries."
747,"We are closing the water loop, through the optimal use of highly treated water and advanced farming methods."
748,"Other initiatives will enhance our resiliency in key areas such as disaster mitigation, carbon recapture, food security, and waste management. We are embarking on an ambitious forestation effort to plant 10 million trees over the next 10 years within our protected areas."
749,"And we are taking steps to care for a unique marine resource, our resilient coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba. We have designated a protected nature reserve, and with your support, will be able to leverage learnings about effective climate change mitigation and adaptation, by establishing a marine science and research park in Aqaba to help marine areas at risk across the globe, and increase knowledge sharing on water, energy, and environmental research."
750,"In all our efforts, international partners have been and will be essential. A key part of this is COP-26 support for developing countries, both to mitigate the destruction caused by global climate change, and to sustain work for a greener, safer future."
751,"My friends,"
752,"It will do little good to address the climate threat in one place and ignore it elsewhere. Human impact, on a global level, has created the climate crisis, and human action, on a global level, is required to end it."

757,National Statement at COP26 Romania Delivered by President Klaus Werner Iohannis
758,"Mr President of COP26,  Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, "
759,"There is no denial that climate change is a tremendous challenge and that we need to show ambition in addressing it!   64%. We have one of the lowest rates of emissions/capita in the European Union. Between 1990 and 2019, Romania has also reduced its CO2 emission intensity per unit of GDP by 77%, a percentage more than double the global average.  But we are committed to do more! Further reducing emissions will be challenging, especially as we move closer to net zero. I want us to work together to develop, manufacture and deploy new green technologies.  Innovation is key. Among other Glasgow initiatives, Romania joins the US-driven Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate. We also need to make sure that nobody is left behind in the process of green transition, jobs are created and social inequalities reduced.   committed to contribute to the EU overall 55% emission reduction by 2030. We have already achieved this reduction rate nationally and we are committed to keep cutting.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
760,2
761,"There is no silver bullet against climate change. A set of interconnected measures can help us deliver. We will harness the very force of nature. Romania has a solid share of renewable energy in its energy mix, with 40% of our electricity coming from renewable sources. We are committed to expand this share.  We will fight climate change with nature-based solutions using 57.000 hectares of new forests in our Recovery Plan to capture carbon and combat desertification.  We also need to channel the force of people in addressing climate change. Education is key to environmentally friendly behaviour. We must advance education and research on climate change. Starting in 2023, Romania will host an innovative World Meteorological Organization Centre, that will help agricultural systems in Europe better respond to climate change.  The impact of climate change has no natioin protecting the environment, making sure we leave future generations a greener and safer planet! There is no time to lose! The time for action is now! Thank you!"

763,"Statement at the resumed high-level segment at UNFCCC COP26 Œ 10 Nov 2021, Glasgow Dr Pema Gyamtsho, Director General, ICIMOD  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! Today, I am here to deliver three key messages to world leaders, scientists, and the business community on behalf of ICIMOD, which works for the Hindu Kush Himalayan region as knowledge, learning and sharing centre. . The Hindu Kush Himalaya, which is spread across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan is often referred to as the third pole, since it contains the largest ice mass outside of the two polar regions. It is the water tower of Asia and contains the headwaters of 10 major Asian rivers. What happens in this region affects the livelihoods of 240 million people living in the mountains, and another 1.65 billion people living downstream. Together, the HKH provides essential resources, especially water and ecosystem services, to close to 3 billion people Œ or one-third of humanity. The HKH region is also a climate hotspot. Even a 1.5 degree Celsius world is going to be too hot for this region.  Therefore, our collective messages here at COP26 are: 1. There is a need to recognize and protect the HKH region as the Pulse of the Planet Œ a region most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change.  2. We call on the global community to take note of the ‚Mountains of Opportunity™ investment framework that we have developed together with our regional member countries to scale up investment in mountain-specific climate priorities, and  3. Our eight regional member countries have come together to take climate actions nationally and regionally using our Power of 8 and call upon the international community to support us with financial investments and technology transfer  We are happy to report that we have received tremendous support and confidence in taking forward the ‚Mountains of Opportunity™ investment framework. We look forward to the support of all parties for this framework.  Let me conclude by calling on all of you to note that the ‚Race to resilience™ and ‚Leave no one behind™ calls must resonate with the nearly 2 billion people living within the mountains, hills and river valleys of the Hindu Kush Himalaya. Let us all feel and protect the pulse of the planet! "

767,It is a great honour to address you all on behalf of Montenegro. 
768,", organized in the circumstances of the pandemic, is a great achievement. I would therefore first like to thank the host  the Government of the United Kingdom. This is yet another confirmation of the fact that, if we respect the rules and strict restrictions, if we are willing to sacrifice the comfort we are used to, and if we do it together with solidarity, we can achieve our goal. "
769,"I believe it is the best path to ensure the most effective response to climate change. Through common responsibility, solidarity and cooperation  through multilateralism. "
770,International public has high expectations.  
771, Everything that we have done so far has not been sufficient to prevent increase of emissions. Climate change and loss of biodiversity are existential threats. Devastating effects of the pandemic make the situation additionally complex. 
772,"Warming of our planet is faster than we hoped, and it is only human hand that can make the move to slow that process down. "
773,"National responsibility and responsibility to global community lead us to do what we have to do and what we have already committed to achieve  save the Planet and ensure more secure, greener and more sustainable future. "
774,nationally determined contribution to emission reduction of 35% by 2030.
775,"Still, we are here today to show our willingness to go beyond what we know we can: to confirm that we are ready and that we have faith to go faster and to be more demanding for common benefit. "
776,"Montenegro undertook to share the climate ambition and to be climate neutral together with the EU by 2050. Integration into EU is the strategic course of our country, and Montenegro will do everything to succeed. "
777, By the end of 2021 we will update emissions inventory in line with the new methodology of the Inter-governmental Panel.  By the end of 2023 we will finalize the first draft of the National Energy and Climate Plan. 
778," Early in 2024 we will complete the National Adaptation Plan.  We will intensify our work on the adoption of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy and join the group of states that actively plan and define policies and measures for reduction and mitigation of climate change.  With the next update of the nationally determined contribution, we will go a step further. We believe that it will include additional reduction of 5%, which will be the total of 40%. "
779,We want Montenegro to be a regional role model for successful green transition. 
780,"We believe that it is possible to achieve climate change and energy goals, development goals and European integration goals at the same time. "
781,I am here to express our clear determination and commitment. 
782,The political will that we are confirming here today has to be translated into a prompt climate action. This is the last opportunity to put things under control and we cannot afford to waste it.

789,       We intend to explore the use of industry-generated CO in possible carbon sequestration projects.
790," Mr. President, COP26 has created great expectations and heightened hopes for climate ambition for Trinidad and Tobago. This ambition includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing much needed climate finance to enable vulnerable "
791," 5 Mr. President, As an economy largely based on oil and gas and petrochemicals, we in Trinidad and Tobago recognize our responsibility in transitioning, over reasonable and manageable time, to net zero. We have set very ambitious targets aimed at diversifying our economy."
792,"We have embarked upon ambitious plans to reduce emissions and build climate resilience, but we will need help. These measures include the following:"
793,"        We are in the process of establishing the largest utility-scale solar renewable energy project in the Caribbean with a capacity of 112 megawatts, accounting for 10% of our power needs, and we plan to increase this complement to 30% by 2030;"
794,       We have developed an e-mobility policy and we are already implementing measures to phase-in electric vehicles. 
795, 4 COP26 will be a critical point at which we can assess whether our climate finance flows are headed in the right direction.
796,"In this regard, the US announcement that it would double its climate finance support, is particularly inspiring. This is the type of bold action all donor countries need to consider in the weeks ahead The mobilization of private finance will also be critical for securing the urgently needed investment, particularly for the transformation of our energy sectors."
797," Mr. President, we must complete the work to implement the Enhanced Transparency Framework.    Even as a small country with limited resources, we will make every effort to report to the required standard, with some assistance, of course. We expect others to do the same. This is the deal we made in Paris."
798,We cannot go back on it now.

801,  Trinidad and Tobago is a small island developing state already experiencing the effects of climate change.
802,Loss and damage are already clear in the aggressive erosion of our coastline and the bleaching of our coral reefs.
803,Tackling loss and damage must remain a critical and core issue of any global climate action framework.
804, We are increasingly concerned about our ability to address this issue given the well-known difficulty in accessing financing for such projects. We need funds like the Green Climate Fund to establish specific streams for loss and damage finance to ensure that this is prioritized in the same way as mitigation and adaptation.

808," According to the World Energy Outlook, in order for the world to shift from our current unsustainable path, we need to: focus on driving renewable and sustainable electrification, improving efficiency, reducing methane emissions and turbo charging innovation."
809,We also need to implement strategies to unlock capital flows in support of energy transitions and ensure reliability and affordability.
810," Mr. President, while mitigation ambition is driven by the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, the global goal on adaptation has failed to achieve a commensurate level of attention and action."

852,"INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LAW ORGANIZATION STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL, MS JAN BEAGLE COP 26, High-level segment 10 November 2021"
853,"Excellencies,"
854,"It is a pleasure to address this Conference of the Parties on behalf of the International Development Law Organization, the only global intergovernmental organisation exclusively devoted to promoting the rule of law to advance peace and sustainable development. "
855,"I will focus today on climate justice, which is an important but sometimes overlooked aspect of the climate crisis. "
856,"This is because the causes and effects of climate change, as well as the actions needed to address them, are inextricably linked to issues of fairness, justice and the rule of law."
857,"llow me to share three quick points on why applying a justice lens to climate action can catalyse progress towards a more just, green and sustainable future.  "
858,"First, fair, effective and equitable laws and institutions can promote international cooperation, facilitate technology transfer and development, and unlock private investment to support sustainable adaptation and resilience in developing countries. "
859,"Second, people-centred justice systems can empower the most vulnerable, including women, youth, indigenous peoples and climate migrants - who have contributed least to the problem, while being most affected by it - to participate in decision-making and claim their environmental rights."
860,"Third, the rule of law can serve as a powerful enabler for the institutional and policy transformations needed to address the complex transversal effects of climate change in areas such as conflict and migration, food and nutrition, health, and gender equality."
861,"Through our country programmes, research and global policy advocacy, IDLO pledges to work with you all to promote a greener and more just world through the rule of law. "
862, 
863, 2
864,"challenges that we face. The Marshall Islands need the support of developed countries in this critical undertaking, particularly those that have contributed the most to this crisis. "
865,"Therefore, we must use COP26 to generate real change in how we address adaptation. We must provide the scientific and financial focus it demands.  The Marshall Islands therefore call on all donor nations and multilateral development partners to address the extremely wide gap that currently exists between mitigation and adaptation funding, and to ultimately achieve a fifty-fifty split between them. As a first step, a commitment to at least doubling of adaptation financing from current levels is essential."
866,"And we must form a strong foundation to ignite a step-change on adaptation movement. Further developing the science on adaptation, and establishing an accurate understanding of the resources required to address it. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5 gave us a firm basis for the target agreed in Paris, and a similar analysis on adaptation is needed. "
867,The science is clear that this is the critical decade for keeping 1.5 in check. We must cut emissions in half by 2030 to make this possible and to stay on track. We must all re-commit to this target and take urgent action to deliver it. 
868,"G20 leaders: your countries make up 80% of global emissions. The world is watching and we, the vulnerable nations of this world, urgently call you to take action reflecting ambition in enhanced NDCs and long-term strategies that align with a 1.5 pathway. "
869,"All nations must demonstrate their ambition for this by urgently updating their NDCs to ensure alignment to this 1.5 survival figure.   In Paris, we agreed that countries would be welcomed to submit NDCs at any time. Again, if there is ever a time in which we must act upon this opportunity to increase ambition, to demonstrate this commitment, it is now. We must come back to the table at COP27 with 1.5 aligned NDCs, and keep coming back to the table until we are on a track. "
870,"COP26 here in Glasgow has the power to accelerate an unprecedented shift in the global economy to a post-carbon, and green future. It is already underway, though far too slowly.  "
871,We must put an end to the worst offenders. Coal and super-pollutants must go. We must put an end to fossil fuel subsidies; we should not pay for our own destruction. Nonetheless during this of the world on the path for collective fight against climate change.  
872,"Critical transport sectors like aviation and shipping keep the global economy moving however, left unchecked, will also spell global destruction. We must reach zero emissions by 2050 in maritime shipping, and implement a carbon levy to meet that target in a way that not only catalyzes "

874,  Statement by:
875,"The Honorable Bruce Bilimon Minister of Health and Human Services of the Republic of the Marshall Islands National Statement at COP26, Glasgow, United Kingdom 09 September 2021"
876," Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Honorable Ladies and Gentleman."
877,I bring you warm greetings &  from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I am speaking to you as a representative of a country under siege from the onslaught of climate change. It is already upon us today; it threatens to overtake us in the near future. 
878,The storm of the climate catastrophe is gathering destructive power with every failed promise and missed target.  If there were ever a moment for bold and committed leadership - it is now and here in Glasgow. 
879,"Mr. President,"
880,"We cannot delay adapting to the changing climate any longer.  No country will avoid its effects and many countries will suffer irreparable damage. We must not only stay within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit in order to survive, but prepare to survive the impacts associated with this increase. "
881,"Some of us must act with a greater urgency and consider more extreme measures than others. As a low-lying atoll nation, we know that physical responses, like reclaiming land and building seawalls, will take the cost of adaptation into the billions of dollars - and will likely still not be enough to protect our country.  If king tide storms and extreme weather events continue to ravage our shores, sea level continues to rise, and as oceans continue to warm and become more acidic, bleaching and destroying our coral that represents our nation's very foundation, we will be left with limited options. "
882,"As atoll nations, the failure of others to do what is necessary to tackle climate change forces us to grapple with extreme and existential challenges. We will never accept that anthropogenic climate change - which we did not cause  be the basis for a loss of our sovereignty, our sovereign rights, or our maritime boundaries. We will preserve our nation and our culture against any and all "

884,"innovation, but also provides crucial resources for the vulnerable. We welcome new opportunities that support sustainable ocean-based economies and large scale marine protected areas."
885,Mr. President
886,"We will not see a safe and secure future that leaves no one behind without resources. The delivery of the $100 billion is vital. And as we initiate discussions on a post-2025 finance goal, we must ensure that we base these discussions on an accurate assessment of needs, and - as always, at the heart of our work - the science.  "
887,The Paris Agreement Rulebook must be completed in a way that puts ambition and environmental integrity at its core.  Article 6 is a critical tool for driving de-carbonization and has the potential to provide a predictable funding stream for adaptation. But the wrong system will set us further back than we can afford. 
888,"Mr. President, "
889,"We urge fellow Parties to honor and respect their obligations to future generations - to commit to the Kwon Gesh climate pledge, and to involve youth in the self determined decisions that will shape their future."
890,"The climate crisis will affect us all, but some remain excluded from these discussions. The in"
891,"At COP25 in Madrid, we committed to using our newly-secured seat at the Human Rights Council to advance climate justice, and we are proud to play a role in instituting a Special Rapporteur on Climate Change at the Human Rights Council, established at the most recent session. "
892,"Mr. President, "
893,"We convene the High Ambition Coalition, and stand ready to support progress at this COP. It is clear that ambition, this year, is not limited to one element of the Paris Agreement, but rather on a package of outcomes on mitigation, adaptation and finance. "
894,"The demands, here in Glasgow, are highly ambitious and difficult. Nevertheless, let us come together to meet them - - for the sake of our collective future and for the sake of HUMANITY!"
895,Kommol tata & I thank you!  
896,High level statement from YOUNGO
897,"Hi my name is Darien Castro from Ecuador, youth defender and activist for ecosystems preservation. As part of YOUNGO together with hundreds of supporters and representatives of vulnerable communities in LATAM we advocate for actions and new reforms that can change this extractivist paradox and still be destroying our homes. We need solutions with innovation, innovation that rises from the youth minds, people with technical potential and skills despite their limitations but that still have needings and empty opportunities. Our peace is destroyed with the criminal organizations control from North of our America to the Southside of this rich continent, but when I talk of richness I talk about the biodiversity and scientific potential that can give us another chance to transform our reality to a sustainable normality."
898," We have 5 million deaths due to a healthcare disaster that we couldn't have guessed was coming. If we can focus on the potential of our nature and not only in personal and corruptive interests with the crime against our rights and our welfare, we will have an arsenal of knowledge from our communities and we will save the life of our present and build a better tomorrow without masks."
899,"We will control our fate and we will be able to do it from tomorrow, that means this Conference and agreement will fail today and the rest of our days."
900,"Our call for action has been done, the rest is your decision and the voice of your conscience."
901,
902,"that are Parties to the Paris Agreement to be eligible for membership on the Adaptation Fund Board. However, Kenya feels that this inclusion should not alter the current balance in the composition of the Board where developing country parties are the majority.  Kenya therefore feels that there is no need to reconsider the structure of the AFB. Regarding the Fourth review of the Adaptation Fund, here is need to carry out a comprehensive backward and forward looking review of the AF  so as  to (i) reflect lessons learnt and chart a way forward (ii) strengthen the AF secretariat operations to effectively serve the PA; and Kenya feels that there is need to focus on strengthening AF regional engagements, with regional nodes to support establishment and strengthening of NIEs 11. On the Development and transfer of technologies, Kenya reiterates the importance of technology as a key pillar to climate action. Regarding the joint annual report of the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network, Kenya welcomes the 2020 Joint Annual Report (JAR) of the Technology Mechanism (TM) and acknowledges the achievements of the TM in the difficult period under review including the encouraging outcome of the collaboration between the Technology Mechanism and the operating entities of the Financial mechanism among other achievements. Kenya is in great need of deploying low carbon climate resilient technologies and looks forward to the continued support of the TM in satisfying this need for the implementation of its plans and strategies for its development and for the achievement of the objectives of the Convention and the Paris Agreement. Predictable financial support to the CTCN is a concern that Kenya would like to be promptly addressed. Regarding the Alignment between processes pertaining to the review of the Climate Technology Centre and Network and the periodic assessment, Kenya appreciates the importance of the processes in enhancing the effectiveness of the technology mechanism for its continued operation for the benefit of developing countries. The alignment process should ensure retention of the value it adds to the effectiveness of the Technology Mechanism in carrying out its mandates in the implementation of the convention and the Paris Agreement; and in ensuring timeliness and harmony with other critical events of the convention and agreement. Regarding the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer, Kenya appreciates specific guidance so far provided to the CTCN in its collaboration with the African Development Bank and the Global Environment Facility to establish a useful way forward with respect to the Africa regional energy centres, based on the lessons learned; and calls for elaborate engagement on the same. Concerning the Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, Kenya maintains that this agenda item be retained given that the positive results of the linkages are now being realised as a result of guidance previously provided; hence the need to continue providing guidance for attainment of optimal levels of output. 12. On Matters relating to capacity-building, regarding Capacity-building under the Convention, Kenya takes note of the fourth review and welcome the initiation of the fifth review of the framework for capacity-building in countries with economies in transition. Kenya urges the SBI continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the framework for capacity-building in developing and SBI deliberation of the key findings in thee Durban Forum on capacity-building and the meetings of the PCCB. PCCB should then enhance coherence and coordination of capacity-building efforts and ensure that identified capacity gaps and needs, both current and emerging, and recommendations are addressed in a timely manner. On Capacity-building under the Kyoto Protocol, Kenya welcomes the initiation of the fourth framework for capacity-building in "
903,"that agriculture plays in our economies, livelihoods and in ensuring food security and agree on modalities to support the implementation of the outcomes of the past ten workshops since 2013 to date. Kenya therefore calls for adoption of a COP decision at COP26 that (i) establishes KJWA as a Constituted Body or Committee under the Convention or (ii) establishes an International Agriculture Program within the UNFCCC process or (iii) requests for establishment of a Requests for Proposals (RFP) mechanism under the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that sets aside a sum of money dedicated to support developing countries to submit proposals geared towards implementation of the outcomes of the KJWA on issues related to agriculture or (iv) a combination of both the three above. Kenya subsequently proposes that KJWA Future Topics, should be subject to adoption of a COP decision on modalities for implementation of the workshop outcomes so as to ensure that there is a balance between technical work and implementation of its outcomes. 7. On the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures, Kenya proposes that the KCI should provide a support infrastructure to enable experts carry out technical assessments of impacts of the response measures. Kenya proposes that Parties should develop mechanisms for (i) retooling and retraining of workers and professions affected by response measures (ii)  cushion developing countries that have fossil fuel resources from lost opportunities due to forgoing the exploitation of fossil fuel resources in order to avoid the anticipated greenhouse gas emissions (iii) cushion developing countries that had invested in infrastructure to exploit their fossil fuels, so as to relieve them of the dead assets burden (iv)cushion consumers of goods that may become expensive to the consumers as a result of  new or expensive technology alternatives to high emitting BAU grey technologies (v) incentivize the creation of green well paying jobs, profitable businesses, affordable quality green products and strengthen the associated value chains."
904,"8. Concerning the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts, Kenya calls for scaled up new and additional finance for loss and damage with separate accounting/reporting modalities. Kenya recognises the impact of loss and damage on women, youth, children, people abled differently and other vulnerable groups and call for integration both the COP and CMA but not limited to CMA alone. It building to include resource mobilisation for loss and damage. We therefore call for full operationalization of the Santiago Network to enable it to catalyse the technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to tackle loss and damage. There is need to enhance the n to develop and implement approaches to address loss and damage."
905,"9. Regarding the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, Kenya reiterates the value of indigenous knowledge in addressing climate change, especially in the African context. Kenya calls for the completion of items in the work plan and urges Parties to consider support for the implementation of the outcomes talk-shop. 10. On Matters relating to the Adaptation Fund, concerning the Membership of the Adaptation Fund Board, Kenya welcomes the decision that allowed all Parties "
906,"mechanism subject to meeting Art 6.4 requirements as well as the host Party authorization and that they should undergo an expedited registration process. Kenya supports the application of corresponding adjustment for Article 6.4 units that are internationally transferred, and that activities with removals by sinks should be included. Kenya reiterates the need for the application of the share of proceeds levied from Art 6 to be towards the Adaptation Fund.  iii. Regarding the framework for non-market approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 8, Kenya supports the establishment of a concrete implementation framework to implement the framework and work programme under non-market approaches. -market activities can include Forestry activities that unlock funding from Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) Kenya supports the development of implementing tools for example a UNFCCC web-based platform for exchanging information. -market approaches can build on the outputs of Koronovia Joint Work on Agriculture such as methodologies that can lead to replicable and scalable projects and programmes across Parties.   c. On reporting under the Transparency Framework, in order to spur confidence and provide the desired leadership in climate action, Kenya reiterates that Developed countries have an overarching obligation to adequately and transparently report climate finance provided and mobilized, as well as their greenhouse inventories in a time. Overall, there is need to clear existing ambiguity in the climate finance architecture around the definition, modalities and methodologies used in order to enhance transparency in reporting. 4. Concerning the items on Market and non-market mechanisms under the Convention, finalized, and proposes that they be deferred to SBSTA 56. Once Article 6 is agreed on Parties will still need to deliberate whether to conclude it or what it will do moving forward without overlapping with Article 6. 5. Regarding Climate Finance, the determination of needs of developing countries should inform the on-going discussions in setting the new post-2025 climate finance goal to enable it respond to needs of developing countries. COP 26 should initiate the post-2025 new collective goal on climate finance based on these needs, as well as science. The report should set precedence to a new era of needs-based and impactful climate financing. Reporting on financial support provided and mobilized by developed countries should reflect the actual support received for climate action in developing countries, including the instruments. Kenya is concerned that developed countries have not delivered on the $100bn per year finance goal and any efforts post-2020 should deliver on the short falls so far and meet the $100bn per year through to 2025.  6. Regarding on the Koronivia Joint work on Agriculture, Kenya welcomes all the workshop reports on the Koronivia Joint work on Agriculture road map this far and is ready to engage on the actionable recommendations thereof for implementation and institutionalization of the KJWA. However, on modalities for implementation of the workshop outcomes of the previous workshops, the KJWA topics and the future topics, Kenya expresses her disappointment that discussions on the subject have been strong on technical aspects and less on implementation. Kenya calls upon all parties to consider the critical importance "
907,"COP26, CMP16, CMA3, SBSTA 52  55, AND SBI 52 - 55"
908,"Your Excellency Mr. Alok Sharma, the President of COP26, Your Excellency Carolina Schmidt, the outgoing President of COP25, Mr Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, Chair of the SBSTA, Ms Marianne Karlsen, Chair of the SBI, Excellencies, distinguished delegates; 1. Kenya is glad to be part of this unique but critical Twenty-Sixth Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), the Sixteenth Session of The Conference of Parties Meeting as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP16), the Sixteenth Session of the Conference of Parties Meeting as Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA3), as well as the 52nd to 55th Session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 52 - 55) and the 52nd to 55th Session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 52 - 55). Kenya aligns her position with the statements by the AGN as well as the G77&China. 2. On the item on Special needs and special circumstances of Africa, Kenya notes that despite the fact that the African continent has very low historical and current emissions (accounting for about 4% of global emissions), IPCC reports demonstrate that Africa is highly vulnerable and impacted by Climate Change. These have led to increased water stress, cyclic floods and droughts, food insecurity, population displacements, resource based conflicts among others. Africa has resource and technical constraints in addressing these vulnerabilities. In this light, Kenya supports the inclusion of the item on Special needs and special circumstances of Africato guide in addressing these needs."
909,"3. Regarding the pending items of the Paris Rule Book, we need to ensure that we finalise it at this session.  a. On the item on common time-frames; we need to respond to the scientific evidence that shows that more ambitious emissions reduction is required if we are to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of 1.50C. We need to avoid locking-in low ambition over a long period of time.  In the basic structure of the Paris Agreement, the common thread that runs through the Paris Agreement, both in NDC and Global Stocktake, is a 5-year cycle. In this regard, Kenya therefore appeals to Parties to agree on a 5-year common time frame. b. On Matters relating to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement,    i. Kenya supports the use of cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, with the application of corresponding adjustments to avoid double counting in the use of ITMOs towards NDCs and for other purposes (outside the NDCs). For consistency purposes, the ITMOs should be measured in tCO2e, and be in the form of emissions by sources and removals including by sinks. There is need for a share of proceeds (preferably of 5%) to the Adaptation Fund to address concrete adaptation needs of vulnerable populations at the grassroots"
910,"ii. Regarding the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, Kenya supports the transition of Kyoto Protocol mechanism, CDM, projects and programme of activities into the new Article 6.4 "
911,"developing countries and the fifth review of the framework for capacity-building in countries with economies in transition. Kenya urges continual support to developing countries on capacity building on current and emerging areas especially matters relating to Article 6 and 13 of the Paris agreement. On Matters related to Action for Climate Empowerment, regarding the Review of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention, Kenya takes note of the suggested elements for the review Doha work programme and in particular the continuation of annual in-session ACE dialogues, organization of youth forum , development & implementation of ACE strategies. Kenya supports a robust and balanced implementation of the 6 priority areas (Education, training, public awareness, public access to information, public participation, and international cooperation). It is our view that the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and other development financial institutions to dedicate specific funding for ACE activities. There is need for strengthening the network of ACE national focal points to exchange views, including via a platform or regular meetings. 13. Regarding Report on activities related to Action for Climate Empowerment, Kenya takes note of the 8th ACE Dialogue, and encourages the Youth under YOUNGO, ACE Focal Persons to continue with their meetings and events. Kenya notes that the ACE forum has multiple benefits, including being a driver of climate action, and a tool for achieving climate targets, a hub for multilevel, multi-stakeholder collaboration and a source of innovation and new ideas for climate action. 14. a great opportunity, not just to richly exchange of views, but to make bold decisions that will spur accelerated climate action and enable us achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

971,  Dear Summit participants!
972,The described problems from the negative effects of climate change are in many ways common for mountainous countries.
973,"Their Governments, including that of Kyrgyzstan, may need donor assistance to address them. "
974,"In this regard, we propose to foresee and include in the Glasgow outcome decisions the targeted funding arrangements for developing mountainous countries in need of assistance."
975,"We propose under the auspices of the UN to establish a Special Fund to implement needs tailored adaptation programs with focus on the conservation of glaciers, forests and biodiversity, enhancing disaster risk preparedness, and socio-economic support to mountainous communities, especially women and children."

981,"Mr. President, We fully subscribe to the achievement of SDG7 on clean and affordable energy for all by 2030, and net zero emissions by 2050. We look forward to the implementation of the outcome of the High-Level Dialogue on Energy in the form of a global roadmap that can steer future actions in this vital area of our sustainable development agenda. The Pacific SIDS will shoulder their responsibilities in the vital area. For example, Samoa has embarked on an international partnership that will enable the timely achievement of its Nationally Determined Contribution to ensure all its energy comes from clean sources by 2025. Small Island Developing States face a shared set of complex social, environmental and economic development challenges focused on three areas: over dependence on imports, lack of diversification, and heavy debt burdens.  These development challenges add to our structural vulnerabilities deriving from the smallness of our markets, the exposure to climate related shocks and remoteness, which together lead to lower long-term development potential and increased losses in the face of adversity. Most SIDS members are not eligible for concessional financing because they are classified as middle-or high-income countries.  The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these structural vulnerabilities and compounded risks. Consequently, the call for and endorsement of a multi-dimensional vulnerability index (MVI) will allow for the inclusion of more than just income-based criteria to assess eligibility for concessional finance. This will support SIDS in addressing their high debt burdens and overcoming economic shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic while safeguarding the progress made on the 2030 Agenda, Paris Agreement and the SAMOA Pathway. "

983,recipients of plastics pollutions and its impacts.  We need more urgent action in our fight against pollution in all its forms.
984,The impact of sea level rise on agricultural production continues to challenge low lying islands everywhere and is compromising food security and nutrition for our population. 
985,The effects of illegal unreported and unregulated fishing remain a major concern for Pacific SIDS economies. Lost revenue is estimated at 8.3 billion dollars from IUU and these are significant lost earnings for Pacific states.   A sustainable ocean platform recognizes that everyone has a part to play in ensuring food security and nutritious food for all. 
986,"Our borders with the outside world have been closed since the advent of the COVID pandemic in early 2020. All our Pacific SIDS have prioritized the safety and health of our people over economic considerations. Like other countries, it was not an easy decision to take considering the imminent economic challenges that will follow. This is how many of us have been able to keep COVID 19 at bay.  We call on our development partners to collaborate with us in supporting recovery strategies that fits our vulnerability and economic potential. Small island developing states simply cannot support our SDGs and at the same time fund our core needs on our own. We need to make development cooperation systems more responsive to the constantly changing realities and development emergencies we face daily on the ground.  As the Secretary-General strongly uld have to choose between rebuilding their economy and servicing their debt."

989,"Pacific SIDS welcome the call for protecting 30% of our global oceans by 2030 and commend the Blue Leaders 30 x 30 campaign. We believe that whilst this target is ambitious, it is achievable with requisite support for finance, infrastructure and innovation.   "
990,"Our islands are committed stewards of the Blue Pacific continent. Sea-level rise is of immediate and grave concern.  It will impact adversely on food security and nutrition, including the benefits we derived from our maritime zones. These are no longer subjects for academic discourse.  They are existential challenges for all of us. The Pacific SIDS welcome the ongoing work within UNCLOS and call for the urgent conclusion of negotiations on an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions."
991,"We are deeply concerned that the increased acidification of our Ocean, caused by CO2 emissions, is already destroying entire reef ecosystems which may never be recovered. Reef damage affects fish population which in turn affects entire fisheries upon which we rely. This is just one example of how truly interconnected the effects of climate change have on our environments, and in our daily lives. This is the climate change-ocean nexus we must never lose sight of and why Oceans need to be an important part of the UNFCCC process."
992,"Mr. President,"
993,"We must come together to prevent and reduce marine pollution including plastics, oil spills, discharge of waste and nuclear contaminants. Every year more than eight million tons of plastics end up in the oceans. If this trend continues, by 2050 our oceans will have more plastics than fish. This would indeed be a catastrophe of immeasurable proportion for everyone. Pacific SIDS contribute less than 1.3 per "

995,"What needs to be done now? We need to build resilience to climate change and reverse environmental degradation. We need to take ambitious actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We must at all cost avert, minimize and address the risks of loss and damage.  We need to protect and improve the quality of the environment and support the sustainable management of natural resources. We must adopt measures to tackle and address biodiversity loss; maintain and restore ecosystems; and arrest seal-level rise. We must promote ocean governance, safeguard maritime zones, protect BBNJ, and eliminate pollution. We need to prevent and respond to disasters; and invest in green growth, circular economies and renewable energy.   "
996,"On the technology front, we urge the adoption of similar instruments for accessing technology as we do with financing to enable developing countries to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050."
997,"Mr. President,"
998,"The ocean surrounds, protects and provides for us in the Pacific.  It is core to our Pacific way of life.  It unites our islands in common purpose; it is our home, and a key to a future of infinite promise.  Our reliance on the ocean and its bounty must be balanced by our stewardship of its health for the benefit of future generations.  A shared ocean means a shared responsibility, and shared benefits for our environment, economies, and communities.  "
999,"Our concerns over climate change and its effects on the Ocean also extend to our maritime zones and the need to secure them, and the rights and entitlements that flow from them without reduction even in the face of rising sea-levels."

1003,"The commitment made by China, Japan, and South Korea not to finance overseas coal power plans is a welcomed trend. We encourage more countries to join the Power Past Coal Alliance to demonstrate solidarity in this vital area of our collective response. "
1004,"Mr. President,"
1005,We note with a degree of apprehension the increase and frequency of natural disaster that continue to devastate countless lives. 
1006,"These environmental threats can only get worse unless we commit to tangible and effective global actions. Pacific SIDS urge all nations to uphold the Paris Agreement, for it is the thread that binds us together.  We must accept the critical importance of reaching net-zero global anthropogenic emissions as soon as possible, but no later than 2050, to give our future generations a chance.  We must adapt to climate change to protect our people and ensure that international law continues to protect our rights and entitlements in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise."
1007," Past actions and responses have been fragmented and plagued by a lack of urgency.  The pace needs to change. COP 26 presents us with another rare opportunity to demonstrate our common humanity, our collective understanding of the challenges that we must confront together, and act accordingly.  We cannot afford the further erosion of trust between the developed and developing countries."

1010,"lies squarely on actions, actions and more actions on the ground.  Continuing the current path, as the UN Secretary-will be severWe are at the point of no return.  Ignoring the overwhelming evidence staring us in the face, places us at our own peril. We need more ambition on climate mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and climate finance.  The need to support climate adaptation measures is of great urgency and we encourage all countries to develop and upscale their National Adaptation Plans accordingly."
1011,All of us need to raise the level of our ambition with respect to our NDCs as nuanced in specific emission targets. We are already doing this in the Pacific. Countries that are yet to submit their NDCs must do so without further delays. And these NDCs must be aligned with a 1.5degree pathway. We need everyone to walk that extra mile. For what we agree here in Glasgow will determine and frame the future trajectory of our mother earth. COP 26 is our point of no return.
1012,"Mr. President,"
1013,"Increased funding for mitigation and adaptation must be found to ensure that the 1.5-degree Celsius target is within reach. Support for loss and damage is essential as we continue to witness increasing occurrences and severity of climate change impacts everywhere.  We must also advance beyond current promised climate finance.  And this is achievable if we are serious, committed, and united. Fossil fuel subsidies must be phased out and resources be redirected towards mitigation and adaptation efforts.  Coal use must end."
1014,"More ambition on finance is urgently needed. As the first step, the promised $100 billion floor for climate action is long overdue. Developed countries must shoulder "

1024,"South Asia Region is home to about 1.96 billion population  and  share mountains, rivers, oceans, energy sources as well as weather and vulnerabilities associated with climate change. The overwhelming dependence on agriculture and natural resources for living, makes the people of this region very vulnerable to climate change. Extreme weather events such as drought, flooding, and tropical cyclones are increasing in frequency and intensity, and have contributed to a decline in the production of grains and industrial crops, fish supply, and forest harvests. According to the recent reports approximately 17.5 million people across South Asia have been affected by monsoon flooding in 2020 amid the COVID-19 health crisis."
1025,"This region is also struggling against the loss of its arable lands and coastal areas due to a rise in sea levels, more frequent storm surges, heightened coastal erosion, and soil salinization.

1072," But we as SIDS, know that despite our best efforts, the real impact to reverse the cycle of decline we are in; relies on the will and commitment of others. For this reason, we will persist to call on everyone especially the major emitters, to commit to ambitious emissions cuts by 2030; implement commitments consistent with the 1.5°C scenario and net zero global emissions by 2050. Nature based solutions should take precedence in our sustainable development efforts. Phasing out of coal plants and all fossil fuel subsidies and investments are critical.   We continue to stress the importance of the delivery of the US 100 billion goal to ensuring the implementation of ambitious mitigation commitments. However, funding for the root causes of climate change is exponentially greater than funding for the response to climate change.  This must change.   We need to ensure a new scaled up climate finance goal that builds on the USD100 billion floor.   We must guarantee a balanced allocation of climate finance between mitigation and adaptation. Climate finance made available to SIDS are still insufficient and are mainly in the form of loans.  SIDS must receive scaled up, adequate, predictable and long-term support from the international community to adapt.  Loss and damage needs dedicated funding. COP 26 must address the long-term and permanent consequences of insufficient climate action. While we urge for COP 26 to conclude negotiations on the Paris Rulebook, it is important that it adopts a Markets mechanism which delivers meaningful global emissions reductions. We must ensure that we continue to uphold the principle of environmental integrity and keep the Paris Agreement promise. This is critical when finalising COP26 outcomes."

1075,"We acknowledge efforts by all parties that have committed to ambitious climate action.  However, it is concerning that there is still a wide emissions gap in meeting the 1.5°C goal.  Even with limiting warming to 1.5°C, SIDS will continue to incur severe loss and damage.  Exceeding this will be catastrophic for us; hence the constant iteration by the Blue Pacific Leaders, that climate change is the single greatest threat to our people and islands. "
1076,"We recognize the double burden of addressing the parallel crises of climate change and the pandemic, but we stand to lose a lot more if we remain in a state of inaction. The COVID-19 pandemic should not delay ambitious climate action.  Instead, sustainable economic recovery should be catalyzed through investments that are clean, climate-smart and in line with net zero emissions by 2050."
1077,"  The development of COVID-19 vaccines was the fastest in history.  Its rollout around the world at large scale required a massive global coordinated effort.  I often ponder on how we can push for this historical, united, urgent global response at the same massive scale to help us reach the 1.5 degrees Celsius promise of the Paris Agreement. For us as the Blue Pacific, we need to inject some of that urgency and ambitious actions, like what we achieved with the COVID19 vaccinations, to deliver the needed climate action.  "
1078,"It is in Glasgow, that climate urgency enters the collective consciousness. We must ensure through commitments and our decisions at COP26, that we keep the hope of a 1.5 degree world.  This is our point of no return."

1081," Statement by Honourable Fiame Naomi Mataafa Prime Minister of the Independent State of Samoa For the World Leaders Summit at the  26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC Glasgow, UK: 1  2 November 2021"
1082, Excellencies Distinguished Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen
1083,"Climate change has long been an interwoven fabric of life for the Blue Pacific including Samoa over decades. As Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we first told the world that our coastlines were eroding, the sea level was rising and climate change was human-induced. Many did not take our concerns seriously; some wanted scientific evidence while others remained in denial.  Now, the recent IPCC reports confirm all this and more. As humanity, there is no time for second guessing.  We need to act urgently and decisively with much higher climate ambition, to correct our mistakes that led to the current climate crises.  "

1086,"Lastly but not the least, the Ocean absorbs nearly a quarter of annual carbon dioxide The climate-ocean nexus is clear, thus oceans needs to feature more in the work of the UNFCCC. This is an important priority for the Blue Pacific. Furthermore, slow and onset events such as sea level rise due to climate change threatens the security of our maritime zones.  This is why the Pacific Leaders have endorsed the Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate-Change Related Sea Level Rise. The Declaration states and commitment to maintaining our maritime zones without reduction in the face of climate change related sea level rise. Excellencies, Climate change is at the heart of our vulnerabilities as nations and peoples.  While we may be the worst affected, the real solution is not in our hands, especially when it comes to global emission reductions.  However, through the COP26 negotiations and the multilateral process, we hope to shape the solutions to save our planet.  There are no trade offs.  We are negotiating the survival of our islands. "

1092,"Dear colleagues,"
1093,Substantial public debt burdens most developing economies in their ability to access concessional and non-concessional climate finance.
1094,"In this regard, a creative approach is crucial. I am delighted to share with you our -for-instrument. And it will help developing countries to adapt more efficiently to climate change finance and provide new economic opportunities."

1096,"Exactly one year ago, during the war against Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan used internationally banned weapons to target not only civilians but also beautiful forests of the large area, causing massive forest fires and creating environmental disasters in place. We call on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent such irresponsible and inhumane behaviour."

1106,"According to the World Bank analysis, Armenia is the 4th most vulnerable country to climate change in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. Armenia has registered a 1.3 degrees Celsius increase in temperature and a 9 percent decrease in precipitation."
1107,"Despite the challenges by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, we are committed to a stronger integration into the global agenda on climate change and to demonstrating an increase in our climate ambition."
1108,"Armenia has consistently expressed its commitment to joining global efforts to combat climate change. In 2021, Armenia reaffirmed our commitment through the Nationally Determined Contributions and declared an objective of 40 percent reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to the 1990 levels."

1113,"However, on the one hand, having all these problems, we have also recognized here the issue. On the other hand, during the hundred years of development based on quantum technology and quantum physics, we have achieved phenomenal achievements in science and technology, and that technology today can resolve our problems be that in climate changes, be that in Covid and other problems that we are facing."
1114,"hing we should learn from the history of science when 100 years ago, great scientists, like Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Heisenberg realized that the classical laws of physics and mechanics could not be applied to the newly discovered small particles and atoms. You have to change your mentality, you have to change your philosophy, your logic, and even your common sense to understand and create the theory of quantum physics."
1115,"We are at a crossroads. The world has become quantum. This is a crossroad that we that was there 10 or 20 years ago. If we change our mentality and form our ambition and strategy, then we can effectively use the finances and the wealth that the world created during this phenomenal development and use the technology to handle the problems that we are facing. But not only to resolve the problems but also to create the basis of development to the brighter future years to come."
1116,"At the opening of this Summit, Professor Brian Cox took us to a trip to Cosmos to see from the above how amazingly beautiful this Planet is and to realize that in the whole Universe this is our Home and the Only One and there is no other alternative for us but to work and to fight for this Green and Blue Planet."

1126,"Ladies and gentlemen,"
1127," The post-COVID-19 economic recovery must be socially just, environmentally sustainable, resilient, and climate-neutral in order to achieve the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement on a new climate regime and the United Nations Agenda 2030."
1128,"Many substantial changes have occurred in our planet and in our lives since COP21 in Paris in 2015, requiring more responsibilities and serious commitments from all so that, together, we may face and resiliently adapt to these new climate and socioeconomic realities in a sustainable manner.  "
1129," With new global challenges, the need to increase our ambitions in mitigating the effects of Greenhouse Gases, and in promoting the other two Pillars, namely Finance and Adaptation, becomes even more urgent."
1130,"Therefore, the developed countries and economies must lead this process by establishing clear and ambitious goals to achieve net zero emissions, that is, carbon neutrality, by 2050."
1131," Ladies and gentlemen,"
1132,"On this important occasion, in which we once again meet to rethink the future of our planet and our own existence, I would like to stress that my country, Guinea-Bissau, a country facing severe threats from Sea Level Rise, Coastal Erosion, and other climate-related risks, and numerous extreme vulnerabilities as an African country, a Least Developed Country (LCD), and a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), which contributes only insignificantly to global emissions of Greenhouse Gases under its updated Nationally Determined Contribution, is very clearly committed to a quantified emission-reduction target that covers the main sectors, namely, Agriculture, Forests, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU), Energy, and Waste."
1133,"In addition, we have set another ambitious goal of reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions by 30% by 2030 as compared to the baseline scenario. "

1150," It is also important to note an unconditional goal that my country has set in order to combat climate change, which is to use our own resources to reduce emissions by 10% by 2030 as compared to the baseline scenario."
1151," Ladies and gentlemen,"
1152,"The COVID-19 Pandemic crisis must not jeopardize the climate financing agenda, and, for Africa, a reliable Green Fund for adaptation as well as the promotion of these three pillars (Ambition, Adaptation, and Finances) become even more important. We need a more gradual, large-scale multilateral response to address the climate crisis, with the alignment of the financial flow at the center of our focus."
1153,"We must reach an agreement on the application of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and on a financial architecture for long-term climate finance, without losing sight of the fact that a better implementation of the COP Mandate for agriculture requires awareness of the strong link between agriculture and finance for adaptation. For this reason, we must leave Glasgow with a commitment to maintain a continuous financial engagement, particularly from the largest emitters, so that everyone does their part to ensure a healthier planet for future generations.    "
1154,"In conclusion, I solemnly reaffirm Guinea-Bissau's engagement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the implementation of the goals set out under the Paris Agreement on a new climate regime as a key step in combating climate change, progressively increasing ambitions and actions nationally, sub-nationally, and collectively in future Nationally Determined Contributions."

1158,"It is crucial to complete the Framework for Enhanced Transparency, ensuring that all Parties can report on progress in a comparable, quantified and transparent manner.  Climate finance is key and our priority should be to focus on delivering the current goal. We need to continue work on broadening the donor base, mobilising the private sector, and to achieve a better balance between mitigation and adaptation, in line with the priorities of the receiving countries.  Portugal is committed to continue financing climate action, in particular through the Portuguese Environmental Fund, in partner countries, such as Portuguese Speaking African Countries. As a sign of our commitment we pledge to double climate finance, allocating a total of 35 million euros by 2030. COP 26 must deliver a strong message on carbon pricing, on phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, and the relevance of aligning public and private financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as part of a green recovery. Dear Colleagues, We know we will not be able to avoid all impacts of climate change, some of which we are already facing."

1161," In Paris we were looking at commitments that would put us collectively at 3.1°C. Recent reports were pointing still to 2.7°C.  This is not enough. And not fast enough. The most recent IPCC report clearly shows that. We all must be aware that the longer we delay climate action, the more intense its effects will be and the greater the costs of inaction.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Finalising the Katowice rulebook is key to ensure the Paris Agreement's full operative and move forward."
1162,I hope that consensus can be reached on common time frames of 5-years for the NDCs of all Parties since it´s the most effective way to synchronize the national commitments of the Parties with the Paris cycle of Ambition.
1163,"On Article 6, we need a result that allows actions, including voluntary carbon market actions that ensure integrity and environmental ambition and are consistent with the necessary increase in global ambition.  "
1164,  2
1165,"And for that, National Determined Contributions (NDC) and Long Term Strategies (LTS) should reflect the urgency of delivering the 1,5ºC goal including through ambitious short term action and through net-zero commitments by mid-century. Portugal was the first country in the world to commit to climate neutrality by 2050. The European Union did so when it made the goal to be climate neutral by 2050 and achieve negative emissions thereafter, through its Climate Law, which approved in the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Leadership lies with those who have phased-out coal; who put a price on carbon; who declined investments in fossil fuels; who invested in renewable energy; and in creating climate resilient, biodiverse territories, with the capacity to enhance carbon sinks, through natural-based solutions.  From this month onwards, Portugal will end coal power generation. In 2020, we reduce our emissions by 32%, in relation to 2005, and  more than 60% of our power generation was based on renewables. We will continue to invest in renewables, especially in solar energy. These investments are now being complemented with projects based on green hydrogen. "

1168,Speech of the Minister of Environment  and climate Action of Portugal
1169,"Glasgow, 9th November 2021"
1170,"President of COP26, Alok Sharma, Dear Minister and colleagues Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me start by thanking the Government of the United Kingdom for the organization of the COP26 and for all the work done in the difficult circumstances we have all been facing since our last COP in Madrid. There is only one acceptable outcome for COP26: one that commits all Parties to a higher level of climate action and ambition; onethat delivers the complete rulebook for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement.  Science needs to be heard and integrated into planning and decision-making processes at national, regional and local level.  "
1171,  5
1172,"We are working on a National Roadmap for Adaptation, which aims to update climate change vulnerability assessment and define further adaptation action in Portugal for the 21st century. And we have submitted our national Adaptation Communication outlining our current work on adaptation."
1173,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Six years have passed since the approval of the Paris Agreement and the evidence of climate change is now clearer than ever.  Leadership must be shown inside these rooms, led by the democracies of the world, with the support of the multilateral process. That is the only way to ensure climate justice. In order not to fail on that leadership we, collectively, need to deliver on the goals that science shows us to be required to tackle climate change.  Not to fail, we should listen tothe younger generations and make sure we grant them a healthy planet and a hopeful future.  We are here, we are listening, and we know we must deliver."
1174,And we will not give up this responsibility. 
1175," Kingdom of Tonga COP 26 National Statement Glasgow November 2021 Page | 3 13.!To meet these targets, immediate and enhanced actions must be taken now, for time waits for no woman or man. 14.!We will persist to call on everyone particularly the big polluters and major emitters for ambitious emission reductions by 2030 and to implement commitments consistent with the 1.50C target. Phasing out of coal plants and fossil fuel subsidies and investments are indeed crucial.  15.!What matters now is action. At COP, two important sectors are absent from all of our NDCs Ð the international shipping and aviation sectors, but we all share a responsibility to ensure these sectors do not cause us to fail to meet our Paris Agreement goals.    16.!With their GHG emissions overseen by sister UN agencies, we must work to ensure the positions that we all take here at UNFCCC are consistent with our work at the IMO and ICAO. For Tonga, a large ocean state, our focus has primarily been on shipping.   17.!The solutions IMO must now adopt are a resolution at MEPC 77 in two weeksÕ time that shows that it is unambiguously aligned to the Paris Agreement temperature goals by elevating its ambition to zero GHG by 2050. And we must work at MEPC to secure the policy solutions that can achieve that decarbonisation Ð and for this purpose we strongly support the proposal of Republic of the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands for a levy imposed on shippingÕs GHG emissions from 2025 at the latest. Mr President, 18.!The need to support climate adaptation measures to protect our communities and natural ecosystems is of great urgency. Tonga continues to use its National Adaptation Plan (Tonga JNAP2) to dialogue with donors and partners to secure technical and financial support to implement all of our adaptation actions for a Resilient Tonga.   19.!Conduct of Technology Needs Assessment, development, and deployment of the most feasible technology for mitigation and adaptation actions in Tonga and Small Island Developing States are crucial. Capacity building is also critically needed to ensure effective and timely implementation of ambitious targets and commitments.   20.!Without the necessary support we will take longer to implement concrete actions and achieve the 1.50C degree goal within the given timeframe. We continue to stress and call on developed countries to keep their promise to mobilize at least $100bn per annum in climate finance by 2020.   21.!We also call on the International financial institutions to play their part in facilitating greater access to the private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero emission by 2050.

1176," Kingdom of Tonga COP 26 National Statement Glasgow November 2021 Page | 2 4.!Survival from the impacts of Climate Change is nowhere else the most pressing concern and danger than in Small Islands Developing States, like the Kingdom of Tonga.  5.!The effects of Climate Change continue to threaten the environment, land, the ocean and the marine resources, upon which, the livelihood and existence of our people, depend very much on.     6.!In Tonga, we have experienced (i) the increased intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones with the 4 tropical cyclones in less than a month during our last cyclone season in February of this year (ii) over the past decade,  sea level rise with an average of 6.4mm per year; (iii) while higher ocean temperature result in coral bleaching of the countryÕs reefs; (iv) record rates of coastal erosion, overflow and flash flooding; (v) salt water intrusion affecting groundwater quality and increase soil salinization resulting in the reduction of crop yields; (vi) Drought leads to water scarcity especially the outer islands where rainwater is the only source of water; and (vii) loss of critical infrastructures, assets and habitats in coastal areas.   Mr. President, 7.!The Paris Agreement was a first step by the global community toward ensuring the very survival, of not only my country and other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), but more importantly: this planet earth that we call home.  8.!We are here in Glasgow to progress our work, under this Landmark Agreement, and to stand in global solidarity urging all countries to work together to address the challenges and to accelerate actions to tackle the climate crisis. Mr. President,  9.!We find a little solace in the IPCC Report that confirms that the 1.5¡C limit agreed in Paris is still within reach.   Let us work together to make it a reality.  We have acknowledged the efforts made by all parties that have committed to ambitious climate actions.   10.!The Kingdom of Tonga is committed, to ensure rapid progression at the national level, towards implementing the necessary actions toward achieving the ambitious targets under its Second Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies.   11.!Albeit our determination, the NDC Synthesis Report, and the UNEP Emissions Gap Report issued in September and October 2021both indicate that we are not on that path of meeting the 1.5 degrees goal.   12.!We strongly re-emphasize the fundamental value and critical imperative in securing the net zero emission target by 2050 and thereby limiting the temperature increase to 1.50C by the end of the century. Anything beyond the 1.50C threshold would spell absolute catastrophe for Tonga, Pacific, the Small Island States and the world at large.  "

FanetupouvavaÕu TuÕivakano (The High Commissioner of Tonga to the United Kingdom)  at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties also serving as the 16th Session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and the 3rd Session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. Glasgow, Scotland, UK, Wednesday, 10 November 2021. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. President Excellencies Distinguished Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen.  1.!On behalf of His MajestyÕs Government, and the people of the Kingdom of Tonga, may I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the Presidency for the 26th Session  of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change;  please be assured of the full support of the Tonga delegation in the critical work that you lead  during this important global climate summit.   2.!I also express my sincere gratitude to the Government and People of the United Kingdom, specifically to the people of Glasgow for your warm hospitality you have accorded to us since our arrival here in your beautiful city.  3.!Mr President, the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is unequivocal in its findings that humans are directly responsible for the observed changes in the climate; these changes will deteriorate with more warming, some will be irreversible and some other effects will have existential ramifications for many of the peoples living on atolls much like the Kingdom of Tonga.    "
1178," Kingdom of Tonga COP 26 National Statement Glasgow November 2021 Page | 4 22.!Loss and Damage also need dedicated funding therefore COP 26 must address the long- term consequences of insufficient climate action in this area.   23.!We urge parties to complete the Paris Rulebook so that the Paris Agreement can be operationalized. Mr President, 24.!As one of many large ocean states present here in Glasgow, the notion of the climate-ocean nexus is of critical importance to us from the Pacific Island Countries. We are deeply concerned of the increased acidification of our Ocean due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and its devastating effects on our reef ecosystems, fish and other marine resources hence affecting the  entire fisheries upon which we rely on.    25.!The Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum at their 51st meeting endorsed the Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate-Change Related Sea Level Rise. This is  an important document for  it reflects our regionÕs collective position on how UNCLOSÕ rules on maritime zones should apply in relation to  climate change impacts such as  sea level rise.  It also clearly states our commitment to maintaining our maritime zones without reduction from sea level rise impacts.  Mr. President, 26.!We continue to emphasize the importance of aligning the actions under the Paris Agreement with the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, Sustainable Development Goals, the SAMOA Pathway and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone Layer for their effective implementation. Mr. President, 27.!It is with the hope, that this COP26 is a testament to the genuine partnerships and collective responsibilities of all parties, in raising their ambition and actions towards achieving the goals, of  the Paris Agreement.  28.!Survival of our children and future generation of our small and most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change impacts critically depend on decisions made here in Glasgow at COP26.    29.!I thank you, MALO ÔAUPITO.

1182,"Your Excellences, ladies and gentlemen!"
1183,"The Republic of Belarus, along with other countries, is implementing international initiatives to combat climate change. In September 2021, the Republic of Belarus committed itself to make a new, nationally determined contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030, the country will use domestic resources to reduce emissions by 35 percent. Attracting additional external funding will increase the ambition of our contribution and lay the foundation for the country's further achievement of carbon neutrality in a time frame comparable to goals declared by the world's leading industrial countries. less than 0.2 percent, we are responsible for the commitments we made and are striving to join our efforts with other nations. No coal is extracted or used in the country. The main share of the energy sources in the Republic of Belarus is natural gas.  In 2022, with the commissioning of the Belarusian nuclear power plant with the state investments worth more than 10 billion US dollars, greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 8 percent and gas consumption will begin to decline. The share of renewable energy in the total energy balance is already more than 9 percent. Belarus has practical experience in implementing de-risking projects in green energy area attracting private investors. Along with the development of low-carbon energy, the country has been rehabilitating drained peatlands. Ecological rehabilitation of 1 hectare prevents emission of 11 tonnes of CO2. Currently, there are 1.5 million hectares of drained peatlands in Belarus. Therefore, to accelerate the process of their swamping, it is necessary to join efforts and raise financing for these projects in the framework of all-European environmental programmes. Belarus has enormous regional carbon absorption potential thanks to our forests, which cover 40 perCO2 emissions. Taking care of forests is not only a state policy but also a long-established cultural tradition of the Belarusians. Every year, our residents plant a million trees with their own hands.  We welcome the intentions of the signatories to the COP26 Joint Declaration on Forests and Land Use and share the principles laid down therein, designed to halt the loss of forests in the world. "

1231," Prime minister of Croatia Glasgow, 1-2 November 2021 Your Excellencies, Climate change is the greatest challenge of our lifetime and this century. Even with the most decisive action now, it will still irrevocably degenerate lives of generations to come.  Resolute and urgent action now can  however  significantly reduce this decline.  As leaders, not only as concerned individuals, it is upon us to enact and implement policy choices to do so. At a minimum, we must achieve the goals of the climate agreements we have already concluded and act more vigorously in their fulfilment.  This is key to narrow the ever-increasing gap in areas where we are already off-track. We must also be more ambitious. This is a necessity. Achievable only if we act together."

1236," As a highly popular tourist destination, Croatia intends to compensate the impact of tourists on CO2 emissions by planting more than 1 million additional trees annually by 2030.   We are enhancing resilience and increasing our aerial firefighting capabilities by establishing a regional centre in Zadar. Its active capabilities will be to the benefit of the Mediterranean climatological hot spot in the vein of what we provided this summer to fight fires in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece and Turkey. Ladies and gentlemen, we must all bear our share of responsibility. Fighting climate change requires challenging adaptation and enormous efforts by economies and societies worldwide.  The cost of not doing so will be immeasurably greater. We can act willingly or end up being forced to act. Any delay will make the process infinitely more painful."

1239,SPEECH BY THEIR EXCELLENCIES THE CAPTAINS REGENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO FRANCESCO MUSSONI AND GIACOMO SIMONCINI AT THE 26TH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (Glasgow)
1240,"Mr. President,  Excellencies, Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, we would like to express our thanks to the British and Italian authorities for the excellent organisation of this important event.  The recent IPCC report confirms that negative predictions are now a certainty. To quote UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the humanity. It will force us to take increasingly difficult choices. Good intentions cannot remain pious hopes: if political commitments taken during these days remained a dead letter, it would be an intolerable defeat. We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C are much lower than at 2°C and that immediate action must be taken to keep 1.5°C within reach. We acknowledge the close nexus between climate and energy, as well as we understand the importance of a just and inclusive clean energy transition. San Marino is a small State but being small does not prevent us to be ambitious. We want to be an open-air laboratory, where innovations by willing and fair-minded people are discussed, tested and assessed on their effectiveness. It is indeed possible and necessary to start small in order to implement big changes, to move one step at a time, but decisively.  "
1241,"REGGENZA DELLA REPUBBLICA REPUBBLICA DI SAN MARINO Therefore, we would like to call on small nations to join efforts to implement common initiatives that would otherwise be beyond their reach. We cannot but call on international organisations to devise new systems that will enable small states to make a stronger multilateral contribution. Together we are stronger, as the history of the United Nations teaches us. San Marino wants to be active with other Nations, now more than ever. In July 2021, San Marino presented its first Voluntary National Review on the implementation of the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda. We are currently drawing and the first draft will be ready by the end of the year. Action to combat climate change, under Goal 13, features prominently on the set of national initiatives. Virtuous policies we intend to implement are numerous, from the development of renewable sources to the promotion of electric and hybrid mobility. Measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, to contain emissions from companies and to strengthen a national centralised data collection system are equally crucial.  San Marino has made and is making its best efforts to respect the commitments deriving from all the very important Agreements that have brought us this far. We know well, however, that it is not enough. If we do not act together, the consequences of our inaction will go far beyond state borders and will harshly affect next generations, who are uniting in movements such as Fridays for Future.

1273,  National Statement of Denmark held by Danish Prime Minis-ter Mette Frederiksen at COP26 on 2 November 2021 Note: The spoken word is the official record. 
1274,Excellencies.  Ladies and gentlemen.
1275,We have two paths in front of us. The first one leads to a future de-stroyed by climate change. Extreme weather events. Rising sea levels. Wildfires and heatwaves. That is where we are headed right now. 
1276,"The other path leads to a green, sustainable future. Clean energy. Clean air. Green jobs. Better lives."
1277,It is not a real choice. The green future is the only way forward. And we all need to ramp up ambitions. 
1278,Denmark will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent in 2030. 
1279,"Our experience shows that green transition can go hand in hand with sustainable growth, jobs and welfare. "
1280,"Of course, all countries need a fair chance. And all countries need to take responsibility."
1281,The richest countries have to deliver on climate finance. 
1282,
1283," 2 Therefore, Denmark aims to mobilise at least 1 percent of the prom-aid will help the most vulnerable nations adapt to climate change. "
1284,"Now, I will speak on behalf of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. "
1285,"As a self-governing country in the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroe Is-lands have their own climate policy. "
1286,The Government is now preparing their climate contribution accord-ing to the Paris Agreement. This includes ambitious carbon reduction goals set by the national parliament early next year.
1287,The green transition of the Faroe Islands includes a conversion to 100 percent renewable electric production by 2030. 
1288,Greenland is a self-governing Arctic country of the Kingdom of Den-mark. 
1289,"In Greenland, as you all know, dramatic climate changes are already visible. This affects the livelihood and biodiversity in Greenland. "
1290," Greenland has taken an important step to halt all new oil and gas ex-ploration licenses. In a few years, 90 percent of electricity produced in Greenland will be sustainable."
1291,"The Prime Minister of Greenland has informed me, on the Govern-"

1296,"Mr. President, I join in commending you for hosting this momentous convergence of world leaders, to set the stage for the United Nations Climate Change conference this year.  As we grapple with the global pandemic, I believe our presence here is testimony to our recognition that we are at a critical juncture; a tipping point."
1297,"This is the last decade, 2020-2030 - the last chance to set the world on track to 1.5 degrees. The question is, will we rise to the challenge? Will our moral conscience prevail? Small Island Developing States as my country, Saint Lucia, whose special circumstances and needs were settled in Paris, are in the midst of crisis for humanity. The UN Secretary General described the IPCC Working Group 1 Report as ."
1298,"Undeniably, certain changes, such as sea level rise and ocean acidificaton are already locked in, with dire consequences for SIDS and low lying states.  But we know that 1.5 degrees Celsius is still within our reach.  To achieve it, we must act, and act now!  Countries must urgently bring forward new NDCs with 2030 targets consistent with the 1.5-degree temperature goal, supported by credible net zero-by-2050 long-term strategies. "
1299,"We must support wind, solar and other renewable energy investments. The power to turn things around lies in our collective hands. We must be focused and resolute.  We cannot vacillate on matters of human survival.  "
1300,
1301,2
1302,"In this regard, world leaders must deliver on the long-term climate finance goal that was promised, supporting, not only mitigation, but also adaptation.  We must also raise the profile of, and mainstream loss and damage as a distinct pillar of climate action and support."
1303,"Moreover, it is high time that we complete the Paris Rulebook.  When we bring to fru-i-tion that vital work, we can strengthen accountability and enable the highest possible ambition, while ensuring transparency and environmental integrity."
1304,"Colleagues, friends, we, in the developing world, are on the front lines, exposed.  Our poor vulnerable citizens have limited ability to respond to climate change effects and so, their quality of life is significantly diminished."
1305,"As responsible leaders, can we, in good conscience, sacrifice humanity for industry?  Will we continue to ignore the science to gamble with the future of our youth, women, indigenous communities, private sector and NGOs?   What are the prospects for nations like Taiwan, yet to be recognised by the UN as a bona fide state, but also confronting climate change, while supporting SIDS? "
1306,"The young people who will inherit this planet, are watching us.  We cannot fail them.  Let us not be that generation of leaders who had the last chance to set the world on track, but chose not to put people first. "
1307,I thank you.

1310," 3 countries.  Although the 100 billion USD pledged for 2020 was not met, it is our hope that the targeted funding will be met by 2023.  But, given the magnitude of the catastrophes brought forth by Climate Change, we believe that the 100 billion USD pledged is not sufficient to address these pressing challenges. Therefore, we implore the parties to increase their contributions. "
1311,South Sudan also recommends that 50% of the funds raised be earmarked for the adaptation projects and that the funds be provided as grants rather than loans.
1312,"Mr. President,"
1313,"On the emissions gap, we appeal to all parties that have not yet submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to do so immediately, so that all the parties are able to meet the 1.5 C goal."
1314,South Sudan commends the declaration on deforestation and land use and hopes that it will access funding to complement its national plan for planting 100 million trees in 10 years. 
1315,
1316," 2 Mr. President,"
1317,"As you are aware, South Sudan signed and ratified the Paris Agreement since 2016; however, we are still in the process of developing the Paris Rule Book. As we do so, the Climate crises is worsening globally and at home. For a third year in a row, nine out of the ten states in South Sudan are flooded. Subsequently over 1.2 million people have lost their livelihoods or are living under dire conditions. "
1318,"Additionally, droughts, excessive heat, heat waves, and irregular rain patterns are causing crop failure and further destruction to the already dilapidated livelihoods of our people."
1319,"Mr. President,"
1320,"As a matter of fact, it is indisputable that South Sudan's emissions are negligible; nevertheless, we submitted a very ambitious Second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and our First National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC). "
1321,"As we will all agree, the implementation of these strategies and plans will only be realised with the provision of climate finance by the developed "

1324, Mr. President; Heads of Government; Hon. Ministers; Heads of Delegations; Distinguished Delegates; Ladies and Gentlemen
1325," It is with great honour that I convey to you the greetings and well wishes of H.E Gen. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan. Although he has not been able to attend in-person due to some pressing issues, he is keenly following the Conference and is fully committed to the implementation of the COP26 resolutions."
1326,"I would be remiss if I do not take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as President of COP26 and wish you success during your tenure. "
1327, 
1328," 4 In our efforts to curb deforestation, South Sudan intends to generate 3000 megawatts of power from hydro, solar, wind, geothermal and natural gas."
1329,"In the area of agriculture and food production, South Sudan plans to engage the agriculture sector in introducing smart agriculture technology. "
1330,"All these efforts, as you know, require financial support, capacity building and technology transfer. "
1331,"Mr. President,"
1332,"In conclusion, to succeed in our fight against climate change, it is the responsibility of the big emitters to raise their ambitions and drastically cut their emissions. It is only in doing so that the world will reverse the dangerous trend that we are taking."
1333,We declare to all the parties that South Sudan will play its utmost role in ensuring that we save the planet and preserve it for the future generations.

1337," In this regard, we need a two-year work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation under the CMA. This programme must address the financing, economic and social impacts of climate change on developing countries. "
1338,"To re-establish trust, we need developed countries to honor current obligations to provide finance and technical support. We must also move with speed to activate the post-2025 Finance Goal because we on the African Continent know that if we are to sustain the notion that rly defined ambitious long-term finance goal. "
1339,This week we must conclude Article 6. Environmental integrity and robust accounting need to be at the centre. South Africa supports a share of proceeds as a source of predictable and sustainable financing for adaptation action.

1343,We have submitted our updated and significantly more ambitious NDC ahead of COP 26. This brings forward the peaking of our emissions by a decade and contains detailed information on adaptation and the support we require from the international community. 
1344,"True to the letter and spirit of the Paris Agreement, the lower end of our 2030 updated target emission range is consistent with a 1.5-degree pathway, while the upper end of the range is consistent with a 2-degree pathway. Where we get to in this range will depend on the international support we receive."
1345,Our country is developing detailed plans to enable a Just Transition to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society. These plans will locate support for affected workers and communities and will be at the centre of these plans.

Australia has the best rates of rooftop solar in the world. Our installation of renewables is eight times faster than the global rate and three times faster than some of the most advanced economies. We have already reduced emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005. Over the same time, our economy has grown by 45 per cent, proving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions reduction. And by 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes that our emissions will fall by 35% by 2030, far exceeding our Paris commitment. And we are doubling our initial climate finance commitment for our pacific family and south East Asian partners to $2 billion. Looking forward we are forging technology partnerships domestically and abroad - with Singapore, Germany, the UK, Japan, Korea and Indonesia  and we are close to concluding one with India. Australia is investing over $20 billion over the next decade to drive the transition, leveraging private sector investment to reach $80 billion in total.  We are also working to establish high-integrity offsets internationally. Working with our close friends and neighbours in the Indo-pacific. The scene is set. Global momentum to tackle climate change is building. Countries with net zero commitments cover over 80 per cent of world GDP. "

The vaccines we would need had not only not been invented, but there had never been a vaccine for a Coronavirus.   But here we are. Billions vaccinated and the world is reclaiming what COVID has taken from us. The challenge of combating climate change will be met with the same way. And it will be met by those who are largely not in this room.  It will be our scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, industrialists and financiers that will chart this path to net zero. And it is up to us as Leaders to back them in.  Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, over time. And achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially on developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life.  Driving down the cost of technology and enabling it to be adopted at scale is at the core of the Australian Way to reach our target net zero emissions by 2050 that we are committing to at this COP26.  Cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies. This needs to work not just in the developed economies of the North Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo Pacific as well. Raising the cost of the alternative just impacts on those who can least afford it. "

We are taking these bold steps to enhance our energy security, decarbonize our country, assist our regional and global peers to reduce their emissions and build a more resilient economy.  The impacts of climate change continue to accelerate and deepen. In this context, we call on other countries to show the highest levels of ambition and commitment possible.  In closing, Namibia urges all COP negotiators to finalize the Paris rulebook, take meaningful action in areas of consigning coal to history, lay the foundations of international carbon markets, and honor and exceed financial commitments made.

In our support for scaling up climate finance, we call for the $100 billion target for climate finance needs to be surpassed as a target, with a clear roadmap on how the committed amounts will be delivered. We urge for an increased volume of grants, rather than loans, to make it possible for emerging economies carrying high debt burdens to kickstart transformative projects.  Namibia has amplified its 2015 pledge in the Nationally Determined Contributions, we now aspire to reduce our emissions by 91% before the end of this decade. The estimated investment required to achieve this target is approximately USD 5.3 billion, 10% of which is unconditional.  These ambitions are matched by the highest levels of political commitment. The green and blue economy, including a green hydrogen industry, are cornerstones of the Second Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP-II) launched in March this year. Green economy initiatives such as our Southern Corridor Development Initiative will drive a more sustainable, post-COVID recovery. "

1432,COP26 HIGH LEVEL STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF UNFCCC INFORMAL GROUP ON PARLIAMENTARIANS
1433,"  Delivered by: Malini Mehra, CEO, GLOBE International secretariat."
1434," Parliamentarians have been observing and engaging in COP26 proceedings these past 10 days. Those not on government delegations, or present in person, have been observing from parliaments and constituencies around the world."
1435," In countries such as the UK, parliamentary select committees have come together in advance of COP26 to scrutinise the process directly with the COP President, Alok Sharma, and his team  bringing transparency and accountability into the process. This will continue after COP26."
1436,"At COP26 itself  both here in the Blue Zone and outside - there have been numerous parliamentary events with legislators from across the political spectrum. This week saw the launch of the Centre-Right Climate Action Declaration uniting conservative parliamentarians around a positive pro-climate action agenda. The Climate Vulnerable Forum parliamentarians representing countries most vulnerable to climate impacts have called for a Climate Emergency Pact to rebuild confidence in international climate cooperation. Their call seeks to accelerate adaption and keep 1.5 C within reach, through delivery plans for climate finance, annual ambition reviews, operationalising the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage, ensuring carbon markets are 1.5 C compatible, and related measures."
1437,This week has seen a barrage of pledges and pacts being made to address the climate and nature emergencies. These are welcome. But they will remain paper tigers unless parliaments enact laws to bring them into the purview of national  
1438, 
1439,"legislation. Since Kyoto in 1997, national climate laws have grown from more than 50 to more than 2500 globally. Glasgow will see another surge of law-making to ensure that net zero and other pledges are anchored in domestic legislation with clear targets, timetables, and resources. Without laws there is no credibility."
1440,"Moving from Ambition to Delivery will require clear implementation pathways, and in every country these are through sub-national bodies, including states, territories, provinces and local governments. For this reason, effective climate governance must be multilevel and involve multistakeholder collaboration."
1441,"As elected representatives, parliamentarians act on behalf of all major groups and constituencies gathered here. Legislators must represent the interest of all frontline communities, including indigenous peoples, women, and youth, to ensure constitutional rights are upheld and rhetoric is translated into reality."
1442," Parliaments are the most legitimate democratic fora for monitoring, reporting and verification of pledges made here in Glasgow. Importantly, as Al Gore said in his address to the GLOBE COP26 Legislators Summit last week, politics is a renewable resource and ambition can be strengthened. In these remaining hours, governments must now rise to the challenge of public expectation to act transformatively. Parties can be assured that parliaments will hold them to account upon their return. "

1451,"We share a deep concern for our people who struggle with the combined effects of climate change, COVID19, economic difficulties, and in far too many cases  real threat to life. Yet, I believe, we are hopeful. I am very proud that the European Union has adopted an ambitious climate law and is determined to make the green transition sustainable and just. The EU has proven that this can be accomplished without sacrificing economic growth."
1452," You can afford it because you are rich, some say. We say: we will help you. Also Estonia has this year allocated 1.5 million euros to international climate change collaboration, in addition to our development co-operation funds."
1453,"But sometimes political will must come before money. There have been many calls for action in different walks of life, from abandoning coal to increasing biodiversity. Some might say that these are only words. But those words have led to action in-between COPs."
1454," However, we understand that not all calls for action are easy to join for each country. We all have our own economic models and specific challenges. Estonia had a very difficult starting position, being almost completely dependent on energy from our national fossil fuel - oil shale. But we have already reduced our emissions around 70%."
1455,
1456,2
1457,Green transition is a reality in Estonia. We aim to stop production of electricity from oil shale by 2035 and phase out oil shale based energy entirely by 2040.
1458," We have been helped by the collective political will of the EU, its carbon market, and its support schemes. But the change is driven and implemented by the Estonian people, their openness to reforms, their digital skills and a vision for the future. As I am proud of the EU efforts, I am also proud of Estonia, our people, and companies."
1459,"I mentioned digital skills. We believe that digital solutions have a big role to play in achieving energy efficiency, waste reduction as well as any other green goal. We want to share our ideas with other countries at this conference and from here on."
1460," Data is an important building block in our joint efforts to fight climate change. For this reason, Estonia has launched in the UNEP framework a new in short. I take this opportunity to invite all parties to join this initiative to improve data management capacities across the globe."
1461," I would like to sincerely thank the UK and the UN for organizing this conference in these challenging circumstances. To our negotiators, I wish constructive spirit. Let the history remember COP26 for its results!"
1462, 
1463,"4  However, we need to go beyond these achievements. We are committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In October 2020, the Liechtenstein Gov-ernment has adopted the climate vision 2050, the energy strategy 2030 and the energy vision 2050. The goal of net-zero-emissions has also been intro-duced into our national legislation. I am personally committed to promote the implementation of these goals.  In the spirit of the 2030 Agenda Œ which embeds climate change in SDG 13 Œ we are fully aware that we should not limit our action to reduce emissions domes-tically. Many of the goods we import and consume are produced abroad. Also, our financial sector invests globally and has an influence on emissions in other countries. Sustainable finance and production are therefore crucial. Many pri-vate companies in Liechtenstein from the industrial and financial sector have published ambitious commitments with regard to sustainability. Such private commitments towards sustainable transformation of the global economy are crucial and I encourage more private actors to follow this path.  The Liechtenstein Government supports developing countries in their effort to improve mitigation actions and adaptation to climate change and dedicate around ten percent of our annual budget for International Humanitarian Coop-eration and Development to climate finance. Supporting the Green Climate Fund is a key element of our financial engagement. Per capita, we contribute with USD 70 to climate finance annually. And the Government is committed to further increase climate finance from next year, with a focus on the humanitar-ian sector. I personally welcome the Climate and Energy charter of the ICRC. Liechtenstein will support the efforts of the humanitarian sector to become more climate and environment friendly.   "
1464,"3  ples™ right to self-determination through Statehood. New conflicts about re-sources and forced migration will emerge, if we do not succeed in our individ-ual and collective efforts. In short, climate change is a global security threat that calls for collective multilateral action. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De-velopment must therefore guide all our decisions.   The time for decisive global action is now and Liechtenstein urges all States to take up their global responsibility. Every state can and must contribute to tackle climate change and so does Liechtenstein. We recognise the urgent need to protect biodiversity and improve adaptation measures and to take early ac-tion to reduce vulnerability to the massive effects of climate change. Liechten-stein therefore supports the Glasgow Leader™s declaration on Forests and Land Use.  Some of us have argued that reducing greenhouse gas emissions while achiev-ing economic and social well-being is incompatible. Liechtenstein can serve as an example to prove the opposite. Since 1990, our population has grown by one third and our GDP has more than quadrupled. Nevertheless, Liechtenstein will achieve the Kyoto-target 2020 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to levels well below those of 1990. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita are amongst the lowest in Europe, despite the fact that Liechtenstein is one of the most industrialised countries in the world. It is therefore possible to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. To make this happen, con-sistent investment in innovative technologies to boost renewable energies and to increase energy efficiency is essential. For instance, Liechtenstein has been solar world champion since 2015 with the highest installed photovoltaic capac-ity per capita.  "
1465,"2   Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen  Let me start by expressing my gratitude to the Government of the United King-dom for their huge efforts to welcome all of us in Glasgow and to assure the continuity of international climate diplomacy at times of a global pandemic. The fact that so many of us are present at the highest possible political level is a proof of the importance and urgency of the topic. I truly hope that today and in the coming two weeks, we will not only speak about climate change. We must move forward, increase ambition and turn our collective and individual com-mitments into true action. We need a concrete and positive outcome of the COP26 and Liechtenstein will support the Presidency as much as possible to succeed.  Our meeting today is much more than just a conference about climate change. It is a conference about the future of our planet, the future of our States and the future of humankind. It is our moral duty to ensure a liveable planet and a healthy environment for future generations. A dialogue with the youth is es-sential. We must also listen to science and the IPCC in particular. What does science tell us? Global warming is not simply a raise in temperatures that leads to more extreme weather conditions and deteriorates biodiversity. If we do not succeed to limit global warming below 1.5 °C, we will be unable to ensure food security, water and sanitation in many regions of the world.

1467,"5  In the course of our more than three hundred years of sovereignty, Liechten-stein has developed from an agrarian into a highly industrialised economy. Only farsighted thinking and clear dedication to multilateral cooperation allowed us to overcome and continuously prosper amidst many challenges. In that sense, I urge all States, according to our common but differentiated responsibility, to collectively and individually increase our ambitions and follow through with im-plementation.  Thank you! "
1468,"The total investment in these two initiatives is around 11 billion dollars, of which the Kingdom will finance 15%. Saudi Arabia will work with different countries and regional and international funds to seek ways to finance and implement these initiatives. In addition, the Kingdom announced as well a number of regional and international initiatives, such as a regional center for early warning of storms, and a regional center for sustainable development of fisheries.  Both will play a crucial role in building the infrastructure needed to protect the environment, reduce emissions and promote regional coordination. it has also launched one of the largest afforestation projects in the world for planting trees in the Kingdom and the Middle East to remove carbon. Ladies and gentlemen, The fact that climate change is a universal phenomenon requires an international, shared and effective response. That response should address three main pillars: energy security, economic development for the benefit of humanity, and climate change. All of these pillars must be addressed in a holistic manner, without compromising one for the sake of another. It is imperative that we recognize the diversity of climate solutions, and the importance of emissions reduction as "
1469,"It has also announced its ambition to achieve net zero by 2060, within the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) framework, and in line with the KingdomÕs developmental and diversification plans, and the dynamic baseline of its NDC, providing that the necessary technologies for this approach are mature and available. This will help ensure that the Kingdom maintains and enhances its leadership role in promoting the security and stability of energy markets. Furthermore, the Kingdom has announced its intention to join the Global Methane Pledge, which aims at limiting methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. To realize these ambitious plans, the details of more than 53 Saudi initiatives have been published, with more than 185 billion dollars of investment. These initiatives include increasing the share of renewables in the power mix to 50%, launching the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program, establishing one of the largest hydrogen hubs in the world in NEOM as the Kingdom aspires to produce 4 million tons of green and blue hydrogen annually, and setting up the largest CCUS complex, with a capacity of 44 million tons per year by 2030. In addition, the Kingdom is establishing a 10 billion dollar fund for deploying CCE technologies in the Middle East, Africa and developing countries. The Kingdom has also launched a global initiative to provide clean cooking solutions to more than 750 million people. "
1470,"Your Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, IÕd like to thank the United Kingdom for welcoming us here in Glasgow and for hosting this climate change conference, COP26. Ladies and gentlemen, The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that we all have to renew our efforts to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and that we all should keep in mind the principle of shared, yet distinct, responsibilities among different countries. Equally, we should all be conscious of the special circumstances of the Less Developed Countries, and we should work together to help these countries mitigate the impact of climate change policies, without compromising their sustainable development. In light of this, the Kingdom has recently launched the Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) and the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI), which aim to reduce carbon emissions in the Middle East by more than 10% of the current global contributions. Over the past decade, recognizing the increasing importance of prioritizing our climate change ambitions, the Kingdom has revised its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), pledging to reduce emissions by 278 million tons per year by 2030, more than double the previous goal set in 2015. "

1472,"6 Excellencies, accessing climate finance is key for Liberia in orderto achieve our revised climate change ambitions. Even as werecognize the roles of the various climate financing mechanismssuch as the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility,Adaptation Fund and many others, we must acknowledge thatthere is a huge gap in climate investments today. We thereforeneed to re-imagine what a successful future looks like in climatefinancing,  and this will require fundamental shifts in the way wethink. Therefore, even as we intensify our ecosystem protection, we aredetermined to join other forested countries in Africa to expandresources available to us for achieving the SustainableDevelopment Goals. Here at COP 26, we must find a strategic balance betweenmitigation and adaptation on the one hand, and commitment toclimate financing on the other hand. Developed countries musttranslate the principle of leaving no one behind into action,through the mobilization and scaling up of capital flows for energydevelopment and energy transition for the African continent."
1473,"5Although we bear the brunt of the impact of climate change, webenefit the least from the existing solutions and financialarrangements currently in place for tackling climate change.In order to address this imbalance, there needs to be afundamental shift in the way we tackle this mismatch in climateinvestments today.I believe that one of the ways that this can be done is to establishan African Carbon Credit Trading Mechanism.  With yoursupport, Liberia will be willing to host a conference in the nearfuture to explore the details and structure of such an entity.  Wewill work with pan-African and other global financial institutions todevelop a long-term regulated market for African carbon credit.I am convinced that these initiatives will increase the chances forall African countries that depend on their forest reserves to attainsustainable economic growth and national development in linewith the vision set out in the 2030 Agenda."
1474,"4Since signing the Paris Accord, Liberia has lived up to its promiseto reduce deforestation from logging and timber production andfrom agriculture. We have expanded our protected forests, andwe are prepared to protect more forests and to intensify our workwith local communities to expand their options for food and fuel inorder to reduce pressure on forest resources. However, is this high level of forest conservation paying off forLiberia? EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:We are all aware that there is an inherent imbalance in the currentarchitecture of climate financing. Countries like Liberia, whomaintain and protect the largest remaining tracts of forestreserves, receive the lowest benefits for these ecosystemservices.  We who are the richest in terms of forest resources andbiodiversity, are the poorest in terms of socio-economicdevelopment.  "
1475,"3Liberia therefore looks forward to joining  and leading in the  U.S.Government™s Conserve Global Forest / Carbon Sink Program,and to joining similar programs launched by other advancednations.  With the largest forest cover of more than 43% in the EquatorialGuinea rainforest, Liberia serves as a major hub for carbonsequestration. This natural endowment is a buffer not only for us,but the larger world. We are a major part of the global lungs whichmake it possible for the industrial world to breath. It is our intention to maintain these forests in prime condition, andthat is why we have outlined in our Revised NationallyDetermined Contributions specific climate-resilient andadaptation measures that we are determined to implement inorder to guarantee the wellness of these global lungs."
1476,"2Upon taking the leadership of my country in 2018, one of the firstmajor steps that I took was to ensure the ratification of the ParisAgreement in that same year.  This was a demonstration of myGovernment™s highest political commitment to ensure that Liberiais among the comity of nations working together in addressing thechallenges of climate change.In June of this year, I convened a National Climate Change andEnvironment Conference to mobilize my citizens and partners inworking together to urgently address the critical issue of climatechange and environment. Liberia™s Revised NationallyDetermined Contributions were presented and adopted at thatConference, and have subsequently been submitted to the UNClimate Change Secretariat.  Your Excellencies, we welcome the U.S. Government back to theParis Agreement, and urge strong U.S. leadership andcommitment in placing the world on a path to meeting our climatechange targets, and in assuring fairness and equity amongadvanced and developing countries."

1505,"To complement global efforts and operationalize the Paris Rule Book, I am pleased to inform that Papua New Guinea has embarked on various initiatives including submission of our Enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (ENDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2020 outlining our goal to be carbon neutral by 2050."
1506," Recently we launched the NDC Implementation Plan 2021-2030, the NDC Regulation and the Roadmap that captures the detailed information of commitment to proactively combat climate change domestically."
1507,"In addition, my Government has passed Amendments to the Climate Change Management Act to guide and strengthen our domestic climate change actions."
1508,"In forestry, we have ceased issuance of new timber permits and will ban export of round logs by 2025. This will be in tandem with the recently launched NDC Roadmap for the Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and Energy Sectors aimed at achieving the pathway to achieve zero-net emissions target by 2050."

1520,"In this context, I reiterate my strong position at the recently concluded 76th United Nations General Assembly session an impassioned plea for major carbon emitters to own up and acknowledge the impact of high carbon emissions to Small Island States including victims of climate change."
1521,"We must take actions commensurate to the volume of emissions. Leaders of big carbon emitting nations must now lead the global effort in rebalancing the environmental equilibrium. We live in one planet, one atmospheric envelope, and one interlinked environmental system. Hence as one humanity, we must rise and unite to preserve our planet."
1522," We must commit to the energy targets, deal with land use, and advocate for the preservation for biodiversity and be bold in financing commitments. These issues are important to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Island Forum members hence we seek support for our domestic and regional efforts towards mitigation and adaptation."
1523,"I want to specifically request the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to consider developing a special set of criteria to enable us to qualify and successfully draw-down financial support. The level of funding that many Small Island States receive from GCF is still insignificant. Therefore, I will meet the Executive Director of GCF separately on the margins of COP26 to discuss and progress this matter."

1552,"Statement by His Excellency João Lourenço, President of the Republic of Angola, at the Climate Summit, COP 26. Glasgow, November 1, 2021 -Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government -Your Excellency the Secretary General of the United Nations -Ladies, Gentlemen. It is with great honor that I address the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Republic of Angola considers climate change one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, due to the set of direct and indirect effects that they cause to the economic and social life of nations, a fact that constitutes a real challenge to development. We embrace the cause of mangrove restoration and protection through a national campaign to replant mangrove seedlings along the extensive national coastline. We favor the production and consumption of clean energy from existing hydroelectric dams and others to be built, as well as from renewable energy sources, with emphasis on photovoltaic energy production projects with solar parks that will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the production of electricity. Currently, the national energy matrix already incorporates 62% of non-polluting energy sources, aiming to reach 70% by 2025. We have just signed in Washington DC with ICCF and Conservation International, an agreement for the conservation of the Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga parks, for the protection of animal and plant wildlife and the development of sustainable international tourism. We approved the National Strategy for Climate Change 2021-2035, aiming to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, as well as an important "
1553,"environmental legislative package, containing the instruments that will enable a decisive contribution to the global effort to mitigate the causes and adapt Angola to the effects of climate change. Angola is aligned with the international consensus on sustainable development, including Africa  2063, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Excellencies, Angola defined its Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce carbon intensity in the production of electricity in a horizon until 2025, and complementary actions in the field of sustainable management of forests, transport and agriculture. Adaptation actions to improve climate resilience of our communities and protecting social and economic investments were also included. We reiterate the firm commitment and determination of Angola to remain engaged in climate action, and to the adoption of a low-carbon development model."
1554,Thank you 
1555,"Speech by Rauf Hajiyev, Deputy Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources  of the Republic of Azerbaijan 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. November 10, 2021, Glasgow, United Kingdom"
1556,"Dear Chairman, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
1557,I sincerely thank the government of United Kingdom for organizing this important event and for shown hospitality.
1558,"The geographical location, complex and unique landscape, combining high mountains, desert plains and coastal zones, make environment and sectors of its economy extremely sensitive to the effects of climate change."
1559,"The reduction of limited water resources by 15 percent over the past decades, droughts, an increase in the frequency and intensity of hazardous atmospheric phenomena increase the sensitivity of our country to climate change."
1560,"At a time when the world is facing the threat of rising sea levels, the level of the Caspian sea, a unique reservoir in the region, is declining. This negatively affects the biological resources of the Caspian sea and all economic activities there."
1561,"Being aware of all the seriousness of the problem, Azerbaijan is actively involved into activities against climate change."
1562,"We have chosen the path of green development. The country is implementing measures to expand forest areas, increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficient technologies."
1563,"Despite the fact that we are an oil and gas country, Azerbaijan has set a goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in electricity production to 30% by 2030."
1564,"At the same time, we continue to expand the network of a modern early warning system to ensure resilience to hazardous hydrometeorological events. We are open to regional cooperation in this area."
1565,
1566,"In the NDC, we made an ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions for 35% until 2030. However, the occupation, in the past of 20% of the territory of our country by Armenia over the last 30 years, the problems of 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons, the destruction of flora and fauna, natural resources in the occupied territories have seriously hampered the implementation of the goals to mitigate the impact of climate change."
1567,"At a time when the world is fighting the consequences of climate change, joining efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, calling for the protection of the planet's forest cover, the Armenian occupation regime has destroyed a unique ecosystem on 20% of Azerbaijan's territory over the last three decades."
1568,"Currently, we have witnessed how tens of thousands of hectares of our forests were cut down and burned down by the occupation regime in the liberated territories."
1569,Today we look to the future. A number of important decisions have been made to revive the liberated territories.
1570,"Restoring these areas includes creating a green energy zone, introducing green agriculture, smart cities and villages, and rehabilitating large areas of forests for a collaborative effort to tackle the impact of climate change, both regionally and globally."
1571,We are pleased to announce the country's new goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 40% by 2050 and create a zero-emission zone in the liberated territories.
1572,"Of course, these goals can only be achieved by providing access to modern technologies and the support of the relevant mechanisms of the UNFCCC, as well as international financial institutions."
1573, Dear conference participants! The only way to achieve a secure and sustainable future and reduce the negative impact of climate change is to consolidate efforts of all countries.
1574,Azerbaijan has already announced accession to a number of international initiatives during COP 26 in support of efforts to reduce the impact of climate change.
1575,"Concluding my speech, I wish you good health and success in protecting our planet during this difficult period."
1576,Thank you for the attention. 
1577,WLS - Opening Ceremony Remarks by Mia Amor Mottley Prime Minister of Barbados
1578,"November 1, 2021"
1579, The pandemic has taught us that national solutions to global problems do not work.
1580, We come to  Glasgow with global ambition to save our people and our planet but now find three gaps:
1581,On mitigation Climate pledges or NDCs  Without more we will leave  the world on 2.7 degree pathway. 
1582,Those commitments based on technologies yet to be developed are at best reckless and at worst  dangerous. 
1583,On finance we are 20 billion dollars short of the 100 and  this commitment MIGHT only be met in 2023. 
1584,On adaptation- Adaptation finance remains  only 25 %  NOT the 50:50 split needed given the warming that is already taking place. Climate finance to frontline SiDs declined by 25% in 2019. Failure to provide this critical finance and that of  loss and damage is measured in lives and livelihoods being lost  in our communities. It is immoral and unjust.
1585,"If Glasgow is to deliver on the promises of Paris, it must close these three gaps. "
1586,"So I ask  - what must we say to our people living on the frontline in the Caribbean , Africa and the Pacific when both ambition and some of the needed faces are absent? "
1587,
1588,When will we as world leaders address the pressing issues that are cause our people to worry  be it climate or vaccines? When will leaders lead?
1589,Our people are watching and taking note. 
1590, Are we really going to leave Scotland without the resolve and ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and to save our planet?
1591,"I have been saying to Barbadians, many hands make light work. Today we need "
1592,the correct mix of voices and ambition. 
1593, Do some leaders believe they can survive and thrive on their own?  Can there be peace and prosperity in one third of the world if two thirds are UNDER siege and facing calamitous threats to their wellbeing?
1594,What the world needs now is less than 200 persons who are willing and prepared to lead!! Leaders must not fail those who elect them to lead. 
1595,There is a sword that can cut down this Gordian knot; it has been wielded before.
1596," The Central Banks of the wealthiest countries engaged in 25 trillion dollars of quantitative easing in 13 years; $9 trillion in 18 months. Had we used the $25trn to purchase bonds that financed the energy transition, we would BE keeping within 1.5 degrees."
1597," An annual increase in SDRs of $500bn for 20 years put in a Trust to finance the transition is the REAL gap we need to close, not the $50bn being proposed FOR adaptation. "
1598,"If 500bn sounds big to you, it is just 2% of that $25trn. This is the sword we need to wield."
1599,OUR excitement one hour into this event is far less than six months ago in the lead up. 
1600,The world stands at a fork in the road; one no less significant than when the United Nations was first created in 1945. 
1601,Will  we act in the interest of our people who are depending on us or will we allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction?
1602,"Leaders today, not leaders in 2030 or 2050, must make this choice. "
1603,It is in our hands. Our people and our planet need it. 
1604,4
1605," (b) WE ARE WILLING AND READY TO GO FURTHER TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS BY 47% IF WE ARE ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED BY OUR GLOBAL PARTNERS; (c) WE HAVE INCREASED THE SECTORS UNDER MITIGATION FROM THE INITIAL THREE TO SIX IN THE REVISED NDC, AS WE STEADILY MOVE TOWARDS AN ECONOMY WIDE  MITIGATION APPROACH; (d) GIVEN THAT ADAPTATION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR NDC, WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED INDICATORS TO ENABLE US TRACK PROGRESS ON HOW WE ARE BUILDING RESILIENCE IN THE NATURAL AND HUMAN SYSTEMS; (e) WE WILL EXPEDITE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF BANKABLE PROJECT PROPOSALS TO ENABLE US ACCESS THE NECESSARY FINANCING; (f) LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, IN JUST TWO MONTHS OF OUR BEING ELECTED INTO OFFICE BY THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE, WE HAVE CREATED A MINISTRY OF GREEN ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL SPEARHEAD THE WORK ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER RELATED CHALLENGES IN A ROBUST MANNER.

1625,"COP26 Speech Your royal highnesses, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.  For millennia, technological and economic development moved at a steady pace. That is until the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which set in motion profound changes for mankind, ushering in an era of change made on a previously unimaginable scale.    In the nineteenth century, the vast majority of humanity experienced extreme poverty; today, that figure stands at less than 10 percent. Two hundred years ago, half of children born died before the age of five; now, less than four percent suffer this fate. Since then, our progress led to the rise of a global order characterized by economic interdependence, which, in turn, brought stability to many regions of the world. Sadly, these feats, however impressive, came at a price for our planet and our collective duty is to ensure that it does not cost us the earth. In doing so, we must harness our productive potential with the same drive that greeted the dawn of the Industrial Age  marshalling the might of innovation and human ingenuity to propel a greener and more prosperous world.  PAUSE  Emissions reductions through investment in renewable energy is certainly a central feature of this approach. But, even as we increase renewable energy mix for many years to come. Billions of tons of carbon will need to be removed and sequestered each year if we are to arrive at net zero and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  PAUSE  "
1626, 2
1627," While the Kingdom of Bahrain is responsible for just 0.07 percent of global emissions, we recognize, not least as an island nation, that climate change is a global challenge that requires global solutions. Developing the kinds of technologies necessary to meaningfully address the climate crisis requires us to both act in concert, but also to lead by example.   Today, I am pleased to announce that Bahrain is committed to reaching net zero by 2060 and has set a range of ambitious interim goals to ensure that we proceed without delay. By 2035, we will reduce emissions by 30 percent through decarbonization and efficiency initiatives and double our deployment of renewables from the targets we set at COP21. Our 2035 targets also include carbon removal solutions by quadrupling mangrove coverage, doubling tree coverage in Bahrain, and directly investing in carbon capture technologies, which we believe is essential. Forums like COP26 and the recently concluded Middle East Green Initiative serve as vital reminders of our shared interests and common future.  We must take advantage of these opportunities to deliver on the promises we make and have made, identifying multilateral solutions that, vitally, are accessible to all. PAUSE  A future net-zero economy capable of propelling humanity to new heights depends entirely on the ability of all people to participate in it, both as producers and as consumers. We must therefore ensure that our work to curb emissions moves in lockstep with our work to improve livelihoods. We owe it to posterity to leverage the achievements of the Industrial Age in order to deliver a cleaner, more prosperous future.  Thank you. "

1630,"NATIONAL STATEMENT By Head of the Cambodian Delegation,  H.E. Mr. SAY Samal, Minister of Environment At the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 26/ CMP 16/CMA 3 Glasgow, UK, November 2021"
1631," - Mr. President, - Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!"
1632,"1.  to join you all here in this Conference in Glasgow. The Cambodian delegation appreciates and thanks the United Kingdom and all those involved for making this crucial meeting possible. 2. This is our unprecedented gathering. Unprecedented because of COVID-19. Unprecedented also because climate change is no longer a hearsay. 3. Climate change, like pandemics, has no border, and our presence here signifies shared concerns and reassurance that, as world leaders, we are not losing sight of our shared responsibility for climate action."
1633,"4. Cambodia feels the crises directly and takes them seriously. To prevent the spread and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, we have comprehensive vaccination, strict health and social measures being put in place. Still, new variants remain a threat, making our socio-economic recovery challenging. Such crises require stronger international solidarity and cooperation, both bilateral and multilateral, including financial supports and investments from developed to developing countries to enable a new path toward resilient growth as well as public well-being and health protection. 5. Cambodia, a low emission country, is strongly committed to doing our share in the global efforts. Full peace and political stability have permitted steady economic growth averaged over 7% per annum, thus allowing us to make increasing contributions.  6. We have tripled our climate budgets in the last five years, now around 2% of the GDP.  "
1634,  2
1635,"7. We have commissioned over 400 MW of utility-scale solar energy, representing 15% of our energy mix. 8. We submitted NDC update targeting around 42% in emissions reduction by 2030. Our national total biomass is bigger than ever before. 9. We are increasing share of clean energy, not developing any new coal power plants and not constructing any new hydropower dam along the Mekong River.  10. We are also formulating a Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to promote activities that can deliver low carbon, climate resilient, and inclusive growth. This also will help us seize the opportunities of green economy  a major driver of growth, investment, and innovation in the coming decades. - Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!"
1636,"11. I acknowledge the progress made since the Paris Agreement. Updated NDCs have shown increased climate ambition. Large economies have set net zero emissions targets. Private and public investments in green technologies have risen. 12. Still, we remain concerned that the level of commitments falls far short of the 1.5°C target, which puts us on a dangerous path, particularly for the post-COVID recovery in LDCs. 13. International climate finance is also far from the required scale, particularly for adaptation, and difficult to access for the most climate vulnerable countries. We call for developed countries to increase their contributions to financial mechanisms under the Convention, and to further facilitate direct access to the funds. Otherwise, promoting sustainable and climate resilient infrastructures, disaster management capabilities, and low-carbon development in LDCs would barely be an empty talk. 14. We expect this COP to address these issues, so pledges become actions. We also hope the Paris Agreement implementation guidelines, including a strong set of rules for carbon markets under Article 6, will be finalized here, to encourage forest protection and promote sustainable financing for adaptation and mitigation activities. 15."
1637,"Now that we enter the crucial decade of action envisioned by the Paris Agreement, it is not a time for hesitation or half-measures, but for ambition, decisiveness, and implementation. 16. I hope COP26 will mark a new era for climate action, at the scale and speed needed for the well-being of our people. 17. Finally, I wish COP26 a fruitful success. Thank you! "
1638,2
1639," To achieve these ambitious targets, Malaysia will be putting forward several measures such as:"
1640,1. implementation of carbon pricing policy in phases to support national efforts to reduce GHG emissions;
1641,2. achievement of 31% of renewable energy capacity for power generation in 2025 and 40% in 2035 in national power grid - 2040;
1642,3. aspiration for 100% of government fleets to be non-internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2030;
1643,4. maintaining at least 50% forest cover as pledged during the Rio Earth Summit 1992;
1644,5. implementing natural-based solutions as a basis to reduce long-term impacts through planting of a 100 million trees;
1645,6. moving towards Zero Waste directed to landfill through the Waste to Energy concept and to increase its recycling rate target to 40% by 2025;
1646,7. transforming cities in Malaysia towards low carbon pathway as outlined under the National Low Carbon City Masterplan; and
1647, 8. increasing long-term resilience towards climate change impacts through the development of the National Adaptation Plan.

1654,9-10 NOVEMBER 2021
1655,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
1656,I would like to welcome the United Kingdom government as the new COP-26 Presidency and for the arrangements and hospitality extended during this conference in Glasgow. 
1657,"Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,"
1658,"Taking into account the serious impact of global warming and the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia recognises the urgency to build back better through green recovery."
1659,"In this regard, Malaysia had communicated its updated NDC to reduce its economy-wide carbon intensity (against GDP) of 45% in 2030 compared to 2005 level. The 45% of carbon intensity reduction target is unconditional and is an increase of 10% from the earlier submission. 7 GHG instead of 3 GHG previously."
1660,"Malaysia also aspires to achieve net-zero GHG emission target earliest by 2050, pending the completion of its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy by 2022. "
1661,3
1662,"In addition, two of our largest energy companies in Malaysia have rolled out their plans to achieve net-zero emissions target by 2050. "
1663,I am also glad to announce that the Malaysian government has agreed to support the Global Methane Pledge as well as the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use. 
1664,"Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,"
1665,"Malaysia looks forward to the completion of the Paris Rulebook during COP26 to stay on track to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. There needs to be a clear modality for NDC implementation and establishment of cooperative arrangements. This should take into account environmental integrity and robust accounting. In this regard, Malaysia is willing to work with all parties to ensure the success of COP26."
1666,"However, to implement the Paris Rulebook, it will require additional finance, technology transfer and capacity building for developing countries. In this regard, Malaysia urges developed countries to fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement. "
1667,"Lastly, thank you again and congratulations to the Government of United Kingdom for hosting this conference."

1685,"Climate friendly policies will enable us to advance initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint.  Our efforts have been complemented by the friendship of the Republic of China (Taiwan).   Taiwan has demonstrated its commitment to the climate dilemma by enacting appropriate legislation and announcing an ambitious NDC including achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  Mr. President, with such exceptional efforts, Taiwan deserves a seat at the table and I humbly ask that Taiwan be admitted to the Convention. Mr. President, the gap between where we are heading and where we need to be is far too large and we absolutely must have an outcome that fits the scale of this climate crisis. "
1686,"Our revised NDC is an example of the leadership displayed by most vulnerable countries in particular us in the Caribbean and other SIDS and LDCs as we continue to demonstrate leadership despite only being responsible for 7% of global Green House Gas emissions.  We suffer the most from a problem that we did not create.  Yet we are deprived of much needed climate finance for loss and damage, mitigation and adaptation efforts."
1687,"This, Mr. President is unacceptable and it has to change.  St Kitts and Nevis will heavily invest in renewable energy with plans for a 35 Megawatt solar farm to be operational in two years and we continue to aggressively pursue geothermal power."

1689,to remedy this situation that worsens with every second that the clock ticks. We are at a crossroad where the science is explicit; that to contain climate change to an acceptable level we must limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C.
1690,The latest IPCC report indicates that we still have a chance but must act now in order to reach net zero emissions by mid-century.  Climate change is real and St. Kitts and Nevis has launched during COP26 a more significantly ambitious Revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) proposing to reduce emissions by 61% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels.

We are here at a time when the entire World is languishing from the horrors of climate change including sea level rise, extreme weather events, and dramatic changes in rainfall patterns.  We are here at a time when coastal towns and villages and even entire islands face destruction; at a time when lives and livelihoods are at stake, all undoubtedly attributed to human interference."
1694,"Yet, enough action is not being taken "
1695,"Let us stand on the right side of history. We cannot wait another day, week, month, or year, we need action NOW.  The World is a global village and the decisions you make in the United States affect us in the Caribbean; the decisions that you make in China,, Canada and the United Kingdom affect the little girl and boy in the Pacific.  The World is depending on us at COP26 so let us not disappoint. I implore us all to solemnly pledge to save ourselves from extinction.   As I close I am obligated to remind us all that the environment and Planet Earth need champions.  I am committed to be one and so is my country St Kitts and Nevis.  I leave you with this question, Are you prepared to be one?    "

1697,"Many of us have faced significant challenges in accessing climate finance for our National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). The process needs to be simpler and quicker to ensure climate programmes are not scuttled before they get off the ground. We call on you to support the pathways that work for developing countries and invest in sustainable finance mechanisms that take into consideration our absorptive capacity and will build our capability incrementally. We need a clear path forward to operationalize the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). A path that is sufficiently flexible to reflect the unique contexts of individual LDCs and SIDS, that supports locally appropriate implementation and does not increase the reporting burden. This clear roadmap for the GGA needs to be set as an outcome for COP26."

1710,"and yet we have made bold commitments in our Nationally Determined Contributions. Currently, solar energy provides 38% of our national power grid and our target is 80% by 2025. What we do is tiny in the global scheme. What we need is a bolder commitment to reducing emissions by the largest polluters. Niue calls upon the G20 nations and big business for greater commitments in their NDCs to meet the necessary ambition and to keep 1.5 alive. Fossil fuel subsidies must be phased out and redirected to adaptation and mitigation efforts."

1754,"Mr President,  Excellences,  I sincerely thank the Government of the United Kingdom for hosting this important Conference. Nepal remains firmly committed to the implementation of Paris Agreement. We have submitted an ambitious NDC that plans to decarbonize our economy in all sectors. Nepal aims to reach a net zero emission by 2045. We will ensure that 15% of our total energy demand is supplied from clean energy sources and maintain 45% of our country under forest cover by 2030.  Nepal has recently approved the Long-Term Strategy, Framework for Loss and Damage and National Adaptation Plan. We have a policy to spend at least 80% of the available climate finance to support local climate actions. We are reaching the most vulnerable communities through our Local Adaptation Plan of Action. With abundant water, forest and biodiversity resources, Nepal can be a leader in sharing clean, green and nature-based climate solutions in the region. With temperatures rising higher than global average, glaciers are receding, snowfall is decreasing and permafrost is melting in the Himalayan region. Extreme climate events are increasing, causing huge loss to economy, ecology and human lives. Around 80% o-induced hazards. During the last 40 years, natural disasters have caused close to US$ 6 billion physical and economic damages in my country alone.   Mr. President,    Rapid warming in the Himalayas poses serious threat to food, water, energy and human security of the entire region. Glacier melting also contributes to the existential threat to the coastal and island countries due to sea level rise.   I, therefore, urge the world leaders to recognize the specific climate vulnerability in the high mountains and accord high priority to the mountain agenda in all climate-related negotiations. Keeping the global temperature below 1.5° celcius is vital for mountain people. It is an issue of our survival. To raise awareness on the climate crisis "

1756,"in the Himalayas, my government will host Sagarmatha Sambad  a dialogue named after Mt. Everest. "
1757,"An LDC, Nepal is making sincere efforts to balance the development and climate actions. We have mechanisms to ensure that international climate finance is channelled to support transformational approaches in implementing adaptation, mitigation and disaster management actions together.  We are engaging with all stakeholders including private sector, indigenous people, disadvantaged communities, women and youth in all our climate actions. Recognizing the value of nature to both adapt and mitigate climate change, we have decided to create a dedicated institution for working on Nature Conservation and Climate Change together.  Mr. President, Loss and damage has become a key concern due to increased phenomena of climate induced disasters. This subject must find a place under article 4.8 of the Convention. We call upon the Parties to agree on making Loss and Damage a stand-alone agenda for negotiations and support the framework of additional financing for it. The COP 26 must ensure adequate support for adaptation in the most vulnerable counties by scaling up financial, technological and capacity-building resources.  We can deliver on our goals only through quick, direct and easy access to climate finance. We urge the Parties to agree on a clear roadmap for a new collective, quantified and ambitious goal on climate finance before 2025.  In closing, Mr. President, the decisions we make at COP 26 must do justice to those affected now, the future generations and the Mother Nature. The future of our planet depends on what we decide at this conference. I totally agree with Prime Minister Boris Johnson that this is the last change to sav e the earth.   I thank you. "

From small towns and villages to large urban areas, we must all pledge to the younger population today and for future generations, that preserving our planet is non-negotiable. We must act."

1791,Our world is still in a state of emergency.
1792," And if the past 18 months of the COVID pandemic have reminded us of one thing, then it is that in order to manage a global crisis effectively, we all have to act fast and we have to act together."
1793,The same goes for our fight against climate change. And I can assure you that Austria is determined to play its part together with our partners in Europe and worldwide.
1794,"Domestically, in Austria, we are aiming at reaching Net Zero by 2040."
1795,"With this ambitious aim in mind, we strongly focus on the use of renewables. "
1796,"Currently, we cover over 70% of our national electricity needs from renewable energy sources. Our goal is to bring this to a 100% by 2030. And we intend to achieve this milestone without using nuclear energy. In our eyes, nuclear energy is neither safe nor sustainable."
1797,Another priority is carbon pricing. We have just agreed a large-scale ecological turnaround as part of an eco-social tax reform.
1798,"This eco-social tax reform lays the foundation for a certificate-based carbon pricing scheme in Austria, while also reducing the tax burden on low- and mid-income families."
1799,"And, finally, we are investing more in public transportation and energy efficiency than ever before in our history."
1800,These domestic activities go hand in hand with our cooperation at EU and at international level.
1801,"We whole-heartedly support ambitious climate goals and the of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55 % by 2030 as compared to 1990.  With this, Europe is setting an example and it is on track to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050. "

1811,"As Austria, we have recently increased our contribution to the Green Climate Fund by 100 Million Euros bringing our total share up to 130 Million Euros."
1812,"However, we have to be aware of one fact: Despite all our efforts across all government sectors, be it at national, regional or local level, we will fall short of our targets if we do not ensure the closest cooperation possible with the private sector."
1813,Cooperation with the private sector is and will be critical to protect our climate.
1814,Because radical reductions in carbon emissions can only succeed through cooperation and innovation.
1815,"Of course, each and every one of us, as individuals, as families, as societies, have a role to play to reduce our own carbon footprint."
1816,"But unless we change everything we do, we will have to rely on new ways of doing."
1817,"Only new, sustainable forms of industrial production, of transport technology, of consumption, of housing and also of forest management will enable us to become fully climate-neutral."
1818,"These necessary innovations, I am convinced, can only come from close cooperation with the private sector  from scientists and entrepreneurs alike."
1819,And it is our task as political leaders to enable it and to support it wherever we can.
1820,"This is critical. Because if we failed to do so, we would risk a situation in which we had to choose between the economic health of our nations and the environmental health of our planet."
1821,And I am sure that you all will agree with me that neither is an option.

1827,"Excellencies, it is my privilege to address this plenary and I thank our host, the Government of the United Kingdom for their efforts to increase attention and action on the resilience agenda. The climate crisis is a humanitarian crisis. Every day, we are seeing the growing impacts of climate change. Loss and damage are our daily reality. In the month of October, there were 15 weather-related disasters affecting over 14.9 million people1.  Since the beginning of 2021, droughts have affected 40.1 million peoplethe highest number since 2016. IFRC and our 192-member National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are responding to disasters and the humanitarian needs of people every day and working on local solutions to adapt to rising risks. But the most vulnerable people are getting left behind. IFRC assessed which countries were the most climate- vulnerable looking at their exposure and coping capacities.  We identified five countries with VERY high climate-vulnerability and a further 66 as having high vulnerability to climate related threats. But these countries are not getting the support they need. Per person climate adaptation funding in 2019 averaged under 1 US dollar per person in very high vulnerability countries. Somalia, the most vulnerable, ranks only 54th for per person climate change adaptation funding disbursements, whilst Afghanistan comes in 96th. Many countries not receiving funding are fragile contexts that are hard to work in."
1828,"We must find ways to invest even where it is hard to do so, and we must collaborate to fill the gaps and get the resources to the local communities that are worst affected."
1829," 1this is likely an underestimate as 1 disaster currently has no data for people affected, and existing figures of affected tend to increase as more time goes by "
1830,"  Internal Global commitments are important, but they need to translate into local climate action."
1831,"Communities, local governments, local organizations and local businesses need to be in the lead."
1832,"We will do our part. IFRC, together with ICRC developed the climate and environment charter for humanitarian organizations.  This now has over 170 signatories, and in this charter we all commit to greening our operations and to scaling up our climate action, building resilience wherever we work.  We are investing more in anticipatory action to save lives, in using nature-based solutions to build resilience, all while enabling locally led action in the face of rising risks. And we need to work together with you to do this.  For many people, survival is under threat today, in vulnerable countries but also in Australia, Europe, and the United States, where thousands have been killed by heatwaves, wildfires, floods and storms.  This will get worse as warming increases."

Speaking slots for those who are not in the plenary at the time for delivery of their statements will be rescheduled to speak at the end of all statements of the same category."
1888," Given the number of Parties and observers and the limited amount of time available for statements, it will be necessary to limit the duration of each statement. Representatives of Parties are reminded that national statements should not exceed the three-minute limit. Representatives of groups are reminded that group statements made during the resumed high-level segment should not exceed the five-minute limit. Observer speakers are reminded that statements should not exceed the two-minute limit. To be fair to all speakers, time limits will be strictly enforced. An electronic/mechanical device will be used to mark the minutes allotted to each speaker. This will allow all speakers to deliver their national or observer statements. Representatives whose full texts exceed the time limit may wish to deliver a shortened version in plenary; the full text of all statements delivered during the high-level segment will be uploaded and made available on the UNFCCC website. "
1889,"Should Parties not wish to speak but prefer only to have their statements uploaded to the UNFCCC website, the secretariat will arrange to have this done and enter the statement in the records of the Conference. Parties interested in taking up this option should communicate their interest in writing prior to the opening of the first part of the resumed high level segment to the External Relations unit at copprotocol@unfccc.int or to the External Relations team, who will be located at the front of the plenary during the first part of the resumed high-level segment."

1933,"The last elements of the Enhanced Transparency Framework created by the Paris Agreement must include clear and simple decisions that are consistent with previously agreed rules. Emission reductions or removals not included in our NDCs, national monitoring system and GHG inventories must not qualify for international transfer."
1934," Mr. President, Rainforest nations have already delivered more than 9Gts of GHG emissions reductions. This is an astounding figure and proof that the REDD+ mechanism has been of immediate benefit. These actions deserve to be adequately rewarded so that we can continue to effectively address the global climate emergency. For this reason, we call for clarity that REDD+ results are included in the definition of ITMOs."
1935,"As agreed back in Katowice agreed REDD+ MRV is concurrent to the new Transparency process. To avoid redundancy, the rules on Article 6.2 must be consistent with this approach."
1936,"Mr. President, adaptation is of utmost importance for our countries. We must agree on a clear plan to define the global goal on adaptation. Adaptation finance should not be a small percentage of mitigation; it should be real, predictable and at scale. Finance for adaptation projects should come exclusively from developed countries."
1937,"As Article 6.2 is a critical tool allowing countries to fulfill their NDCs, it should include incentives for early, pre-2020 REDD+ actions and should only include activities inside their respective NDCs. This is the only way to reach the 1.5C goal. REDD+ is part of the Paris Agreement. The CDM is part of the past. "
1938,"Mr. President, we have all made sacrifices attend COP 26, travelling during a global pandemic. It is therefore imperative that we respect all views and engage all parties to make Glasgow a success. As usual, you can count on us and our support to deliver what is world is expecting."

1949,The 1.5-degree goal is unattainable without REDD+ and . Dramatically slowing global deforestation is needed and the REDD+ Mechanism is singularly designed to achieve that goal.
1950,"Article 5 of the Paris Agreement defines REDD+ as the only mechanism to implement forestry activities. Whether it is deforestation, degradation or conservation, REDD+ is our north star.  It is based on a set of decisions that have been agreed and are now being implemented."
1951,Developing countries are now hard at work on Article 5 which should not be re-opened!  Our work to date should not be disrupted!
1952,"Mr. President, environmental integrity must be at the core of our work and the Glasgow outcome must be built on this principle.

1956,"Chair,  Roz Foyer, General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, speaking on behalf of the Trade union NGOs.  The global trade union movement is watching. Workers around the world are living the impact of climate change that is getting worse year after year. Droughts, floods and heat waves are affecting their livelihoods.  40 years of privatisation and marketisation has led to broken communities, economy inequality, and environmental injustice on a planetary scale. We need a Just Transition based on full employment, high-quality public services, and unionised jobs. - We want clear support for Just Transition with human and labour rights in the core of the Glasgow Agreement and in the decisions on Article 6 and Response Measures."
1957,"- Countries need to step up their 2030 NDCs in line with a 1.5°C trajectory before the conclusion of the 2023 Global Stocktake.  - We want guarantees from the rich countries to deliver the climate finance that they promised in 2009. This shameful situation must end.  - We also want more money for climate adaptation and a finance mechanism for loss and damage.  People are waking up to your lack of action. Outside these fences, cleansing workers join hands with youth climate strikers. And when we join together, the ordinary people who care about the future of our planet, climate activists, indigenous communities, the anti-racist movement, the feminist movement, young people, trade unionists, and all of the people who are fighting for a fairer future, we are more powerful, than you can dare to imagine.

1960," Mr President,  distinguished delegates! Let me begin by thanking the UK and Prime Minister Boris Johnson for leadership as our host and co-president of COP26."
1961, It has been six years since we all took up commitments in Paris. We know we are not on track to meet them. 
1962,There is no time to lose. Keeping the 1.5 °C target within reach is a must. It is the minimum that COP26 should deliver.
1963,"My country, Latvia, is no exception in experiencing the increasing effects of climate change. With almost 500km of coastline, we are keenly aware of coastal erosion risks. Extreme climate-related incidents in Europe are becoming more common. "
1964,"Latvia contributes only 0.02% of world greenhouse gas emissions, yet we will uphold our commitments in this field - at the national level, within the EU and in the  UN framework."
1965," Mitigation efforts are urgently needed. We must be bold. This is the common task of national governments, international organisations, public and private sectors, our societies. Each individual is a crucial stakeholder. "
1966,We must persuade bring greater prosperity and security. A new mindset is required.  Changes in our behaviour and a transition to a green economy are in the long-term interest of humankind.
1967,"All too often support for climate-friendly policies is in words only. To a certain extent I observe this in my country, too-, a high percentage of  energy mix comes from renewables.  More than half of our land is covered by forest.  Our greenhouse gas emissions per capita have decreased by more than a third since 1990.  Yet I often meet resistance to pro-active steps that would decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. There is still much to be done, especially in the fields of energy, transport and agriculture.  "
1968," While we work towards limiting climate change, adaptation is also essential. "
1969,
1970,"Necessary changes may create social challenges.  Certain individuals, groups and nations will in the short and medium term suffer losses.  The concerns of those who mistrust and refuse to accept the climate agenda must be answered."
1971,"In order to promote reform, it is necessary to create mechanisms which would at least partially off-set their losses.   Crucially, such mechanisms need to be backed by adequate resources. "
1972,"Greater interaction between science and business is also urgently needed. Scaling up of investments in green technologies is key to sustainable growth. Synergies between different financial instruments, public support mechanisms and private resources need to be strengthened."
1973," A robust framework of rules to ensure environmental integrity of the system and promote ambition must be  an outcome of this COP 26. This includes rules on transparency, as well as on markets. "
1974,We must also be able to move beyond pledges and tackle the fine print: how will the transition work in practice? Who is going to pay for it? Who is going to carry the heaviest burden? 
1975," Mr President,"
1976,"As you have rightly said, we have no choice but to deliver. "
1977,"The call to action is loud and clear, especially from our youth.  For them, climate change is an existential threat.  Theyare right to demand our leadership. I, as President of Latvia, will do my part. "

We have been consistent for over a decade on the need to limit warming to below 1.5 degrees and are pleased to see that at last, the global community now united behind this goal. We have heard the pledges and the promises. We now need to have these backed by action. Action on adaptation and resilience building, with the scaling up of adaptation finance to at least double current levels. And dedicated financing for loss and damage.  We need to mobilize and deploy the promised $100bn and the trillions needed to support developing countries.  Glasgow is an opportunity for our global community to respond with unity and solidarity, and we call on all parties to step up to the plate.  We acknowledge that the transformation that is required will have its challenges and call for a just transition that leaves no one behind. We have 3 days left to complete our work here and there is still a lot of heavy lifting to be done. clear - we cannot leave Glasgow without having done enough to keep the 1.5 goal within reach, and satisfactory outcomes on adaption and finance.

2033,"At the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille two months ago, 1,500 of  which include many governments here today  highlighted the interlinked nature of the biodiversity and climate crises. "
2034,The key message from Marseille was that nature is a powerful ally in the fight against climate change and we need to invest in Nature-based Solutions.
2035,The unique value proposition of Nature-based Solutions is that they offer a cost-effective and accessible way to address both adaptation and mitigation simultaneously.
2036,"However, we stress that this needs to be done in conjunction with the ambitious and rapid reduction of fossil fuel and other industrial emissions."
2037,"This COP has underscored the value and importance of nature as never before. We congratulate the UK COP26 Presidency for prioritising Nature and Nature-based Solutions, and note the significant groundswell of support for it among state and non-state actors alike."
2038,"We now need to build concretely on this momentum. This is why today, IUCN calls upon all Parties to actively recognise and support the enhanced implementation of Nature-based Solutions in the decision text of the COP."
2039,"We believe this would give confidence to all actors to deploy Nature-based Solutions at scale, and help to unlock its full potential in addressing the climate challenge."

2044,Statement by Secretary General Dr. Young Tae Kim
2045," Your Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,"
2046,"It is a great honour to address you all on behalf of the International Transport Forum.  As a sector that emits around a quarter of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, transport policies are critical to climate action.  By 2050, passenger demand is projected to be more than twice 2015 levels, while freight demand is set to grow by a factor of 2.6 in the same period.  Based on the current trajectory, transport CO2 emissions are projected to grow by 16% between 2015 and 2050, reaching nearly 8.7 Giga tonnes.  Yet only 16% of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) included specific transport emissions reduction targets. "
2047,We already know that current policies will not be enough to reduce transport emissions sufficiently as any advances in decarbonising transport will be more than offset by increased demand for mobility.  But more ambitious policies coupled with a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could put the transport sector on a path to achieving the necessary reductions for the Paris Agreement.  
2048,"There are six top tasks for policy makers.  The first is to increase ambition.  The second is to align policies to revive the economy, mitigate climate change and strengthen equity.  The third is to focus on accessibility and create seamless trips and increase opportunities.  The fourth is to target sectors with strategies geared to their emissions reduction potential.  Urban mobility has the highest potential, road freight and aviation are the hardest to decarbonise.  The fifth is to support innovation to accelerate technological breakthroughs needed to decarbonise transport.  And the sixth task is to break down silos and boost collaboration between interdependent sectors, such as transport, energy, tourism and trade.  Only stronger cooperation among sectors will enable more ambitious climate action. "
2049,Thank you very much.
